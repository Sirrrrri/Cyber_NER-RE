This variant abuses Instagram and Tumblr profiles to hide its C&C server. <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0 targets South Korean <e2>Android</e2> users.
Security researchers have discovered over 17,000 new <e1>Anubis</e1> samples targeting over 377 banking applications spread in 93 countries, including the United States, Europe, and <e2>India</e2>. Operation of Anubis banking malware Anubis banking trojan targets smartphones running the Android Operating System.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner. All have now been removed from Google Play, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that Facebook and YouTube pages advertising some of them were still up. If you install one of these innocent-looking apps, it collects information about your device and your surroundings, but otherwise does nothing terrible. If the app didn't work well for its advertised purposes and you complained about it on Google Play, the malware operators would apologize and make improvements. "We estimate the number of victims in the tens of thousands for the current wave, and probably hundreds of thousands throughout the full 4-year period," Bitdefender wrote in its report. But the first stage would also tricked you into authorizing app installations from outside the <e2>Google Play</e2> store, after which it would download and install the second stage — the "loader," which calls itself "Android system" to avoid attention.
0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500—a low price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers. <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> can target mobile devices that are running <e2>Android versions of up to 6.0</e2>, which was released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores.
This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these <e2>Android</e2> samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: google.servlce.store gooogle.services goooogle.services <e1>play.google.servlce.store</e1> play.
“Among other things, <e1>Monokle</e1> makes extensive use of the <e2>Android</e2> accessibility services to exfiltrate data from third party applications and uses predictive-text dictionaries to get a sense of the topics of interest to a target.
An <e2>Android</e2> malware called <e1>TangleBot</e1> has weaved its way onto the cyber-scene: One that researchers said can perform a bouquet of malicious actions, including stealing personal info and controlling apps and device functions.
LESS-SOPHISTICATED EXODUS IOS VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit conference, the team at Lookout said it discovered an <e2>iOS</e2> variant of this spyware during their analysis of <e1>Exodus</e1> samples they've found last year.
The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware <e1>Triout</e1>. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “<e2>Sex Game For Adults</e2>.” Attackers aim to backdoor legitimate applications with an unusual injection technique dubbed Smali.
For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The HackingTeam’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and <e2>BlackBerry</e2> phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and <e2>LinkedIn</e2> Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.
” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and <e1>sdfkjhl2.)</e1> As of this writing, no files were hosted at any of the links.
A third stage would attempt to let <e1>Exodus</e1> gain root control over an infected phone, typically though the use of an exploit dubbed <e2>DirtyCOW</e2>. Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.
It was spread in apps disguised as service applications from Italian mobile operators. <e1>Exodus</e1> was hidden inside apps available on phishing websites and nearly 25 apps available in <e2>Google Play</e2>. In a report published two weeks ago, researchers at Security without Borders said Exodus infected phones estimated to be in the "several hundreds if not a thousand or more.
Two days later, Stefanko and colleagues "detected an active campaign using this new banking Trojan with thousands of website visits that contained the payload. <e1>Cerberus</e1> was spread via a fake website that asked users to install <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2>." Stefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used "a web framework where anyone can check website visit statistics—because of that I found out which countries are targeted with actual number of site visits.
The <e1>coup de grâce</e1> is a command built into the malware called "<e2>seppuku</e2>," named after a form of Japanese ritual suicide.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module “ip” This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off “VerifyApps” and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the “initial phase”, the Trojan will install the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app. Its main purpose is to download archives and execute the “start” binary from them. During the investigation, this app was able to successfully connect to the command and control server, but it received no commands. So I don’t know what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files. Conclusions This Trojan was distributed through the Google Play Store and uses a number of very dangerous techniques, including patching system libraries. It installs malicious modules with different functionality into the system. It looks like its main purpose is to get into the system and execute downloaded files with root rights. But I never received such files from their command and control server. These malicious modules report to the attackers about every step they are going to make. So I think that the authors are still testing this malware, because they use some techniques which can break the infected devices. But they already have a lot of infected users on whom to test their methods. I hope that by uncovering this malware at such an early stage, we will be able to prevent a massive and dangerous attack when the attackers are ready to actively use their methods.

RCSAndroid has 4 'critical components': Penetration solutions – Methods to get into the device, either via SMS or email or a legitimate app Low-level native code – Advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android's security framework High-level Java agent – The application's malicious APK Command-and-control (C&C) servers – Servers used to remotely send or receive malicious commands Given that the source code of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> is now available to everybody, it will likely put Android users in danger. So, if you own a smartphone running any <e2>Android</e2> version from 4.
Static Analysis of <e2>Cerberus</e2> A quick look at the original manifest This sophisticated trojan has a large AndroidManifest file: lots of receivers, activities, services, intent-filters etc. The code found in the distributed APK is the same in the majority of classes”. The code is heavily obfuscated and has no real purpose other than to waste the analyst’s time. Besides the heavily obfuscated package name, two activities that caught our attention were: Why would such an app want to send and receive text messages, record audio, and read the user’s contact list? And the fact that, the path to the class names is not found (the root element qugyujzldpxqazyrqtc is not present on the left side, under “Source code”). Analyzing the payload The payload of this variant is a dex file named <e1>RRoj.json.</e1> When the payload is decompiled, it shows the obfuscated code of the malware.
Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e1>DualToy</e1> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an <e2>iOS</e2> device.
Sophisticated <e1>RedDrop</e1> Malware Targets Android Phones A new strain of mobile malware found on an array of apps can pull out sensitive data – including audio recordings – from Android phones. A sophisticated strain of mobile malware targeting <e2>Android</e2> devices can extract sensitive data and audio recordings, run up premium SMS charges and then tries to extort money from victims.
For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “/[number]” (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. In this version of Rotexy, dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used. 2016 From mid-2016 on, the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains. No other significant changes were observed in the Trojan’s network behavior. In late 2016, versions of the Trojan emerged that contained the card.html phishing page in the assets/www folder. The page was designed to steal users’ bank card details: 2017–2018 From early 2017, the HTML phishing pages bank.html, <e1>update.html</e1> and extortionist.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, <e2>Georgia</e2>, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, <e1>mike.jar</e1> connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service.
When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a <e2>local privilege escalation vulnerability</e2> in Android devices.
The fake applications are built using WebView, a popular extension of Android’s View class that lets the developer show a webpage. <e2>FakeSpy</e2> uses this view to redirect users to the original post office carrier webpage on launch of the application, continuing the deception. This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface. FAKESPY CODE ANALYSIS Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources. This configuration can be toggled on by going to ‘Settings’ -> ‘Security’ -> ‘Unknown Resources’. PackageInstaller shows the app’s permission access and asks for the user's approval, which then installs the application. This analysis dissects FakeSpy’s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions. DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOADING Once the application has finished the installation process, the malware starts its real malicious activity. The malicious application da.hao.pao.bin (Chunghwa Post) loads a library file libmsy.so used to execute the packed mycode.jar file. The JAR file is the decrypted version of the file tong.luo, which is located in the assets folder. By comparing the sizes of the encrypted asset file tong.luo vs the decrypted JAR file mycode.jar, it is interesting to note that it is the same file (almost the same size). After libmsy.so decrypts the asset file <e1>tong.luo,</e1> it loads mycode.
Once installed, <e1>Pegasus</e1> exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including <e2>Gmail</e2>, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more.
Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise Exodus One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b <e2>Exodus</e2> One Package Names <e1>com.phonecarrier.linecheck</e1> rm.

Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV Hotstar Trump Dash <e2>PokemonGo</e2> With many more to come. Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same <e1>SpyNote</e1> Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild.
Here are some of the features of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, <e2>Viber</e2>, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger.
In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known <e2>Android</e2> banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed <e1>Alien</e1>, and explain how it relates to infamous Cerberus malware, who’s service has recently been discontinued.
It’s interesting that we can recover its original file name which is fb_mem_root. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 also gain root privilege thought another method that doesn’t use “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drop files including sux, getroot, <e1>logo.png</e1> and busybox_g1 from assets to the app’s own data directory.
It started as a SMS stealer and rapidly evolved into one of the most advanced actors in the financial fraud landscape. <e1>Ginp</e1> has primarily targeted <e2>Spanish banks</e2>, but recent evidence suggests the malware has changed or may change its targeting strategy in the near future to focus on Turkey.
apk to view the message” Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, <e1>MazarBOT</e1> downloads a copy of Tor onto users’ <e2>Android</e2> smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim’s location to an Iranian mobile phone number.
According to public records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. <e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities. Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering. Disguised Spyware Uploaded on <e2>Google Play Store</e2> We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years.
If the <e2>banking app</e2> is targeted by <e1>Ginp</e1>, the server will respond with a command of “START_INJ” for the malware to start the overlay attack.
New XLoader Variant Masquerades as Android Security Apps, iOS Configuration Profile A new variant of <e1>XLoader</e1> is masquerading as <e2>Android security apps</e2> and an iOS configuration profile to target mobile users.
In its analysis, CSIS notes that <e1>MazarBOT</e1> was reported by Recorded Future last November as being actively sold in Russian underground forums and intriguingly, the malware will not activate on <e2>Android</e2> devices configured with Russian language settings.
<e1>Judy</e1> malware may have infected 36 million <e2>Android</e2> devices.
However, it is possible that set of command change in future for <e1>Rotexy</e1> Trojan. Also, As per Kaspersky 98% users are targeted in <e2>Russia</e2> only rest few cases have seen in Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, and a few other countries.
After downloading it, <e2>DualToy</e2> will copy the IPA file via the AFC service to the iOS device’s /var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging directory, and then install it via the installation_proxy service. The downloaded <e1>kuaiyong.ipa</e1> has an obfuscated bundle ID of “pWsbshWBn5XN9kk0twBUECAVt2E.
Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to <e2>Pegasus</e2>, which we named <e1>Chrysaor</e1>. Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps.
We named the malware <e2>Skygofree</e2>, because we found the word in one of the domains*. Malware Features Android According to the observed samples and their signatures, early versions of this Android malware were developed by the end of 2014 and the campaign has remained active ever since. The code and functionality have changed numerous times; from simple unobfuscated malware at the beginning to sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device. We have examined all the detected versions, including the latest one that is signed by a certificate valid from September 14, 2017. The implant provides the ability to grab a lot of exfiltrated data, like call records, text messages, geolocation, surrounding audio, calendar events, and other memory information stored on the device. After manual launch, it shows a fake welcome notification to the user: Dear Customer, we’re updating your configuration and it will be ready as soon as possible. At the same time, it hides an icon and starts background services to hide further actions from the user. Service Name Purpose AndroidAlarmManager Uploading last recorded .amr audio AndroidSystemService Audio recording AndroidSystemQueues Location tracking with movement detection ClearSystems GSM tracking (CID, LAC, PSC) ClipService Clipboard stealing AndroidFileManager Uploading all exfiltrated data AndroidPush XMPP С&C protocol (url.plus:5223) RegistrationService Registration on C&C via HTTP (<e1>url.plus/app/pro/</e1>) Interestingly, a self-protection feature was implemented in almost every service.
However, within six months the malicious actors added the capability to infect iOS devices. <e1>DualToy</e1> is still active and we have detected over 8,000 unique samples belonging to this Trojan family to date. It mainly targets Chinese users, but has also successfully affected people and organizations in the United States, <e2>United Kingdom</e2>, Thailand, Spain, and Ireland.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, <e2>Viber</e2>, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
How RCSAndroid hacking tool infects a Target? <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> uses two different methods to infect targeted Android devices. 1. Hacking Team used text and email messages containing specially crafted URLs that triggered exploits for several vulnerabilities (<e2>CVE-2012-2825</e2> and CVE-2012-2871) present in the default browsers of Android 4.
Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that <e1>Ginp</e1> malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of <e2>Turkish banks</e2>, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in Poland and the United Kingdom.
As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, Germany, United States of America, Italy, France, <e2>Poland</e2>, Australia and the United Kingdom.
tk, etc Rotexy mobile malware keeps requesting the mobile administrative privilege even users restart the mobile in safe mode even the malicious program will be removed. <e1>Rotexy</e1> mainly targeting Russian user’s, up to 98% of its infection in <e2>Russia</e2> and it also infecting users in Ukraine, Germany, Turkey, and several other countries.
The "porn kr sex" APK connects to a malicious website that runs <e1>XLoader</e1> in the background. The website uses a different fixed twitter account (https://twitter.com/fdgoer343). This attack, however, seems exclusive to Android users, as it does not have the code to attack iOS devices. Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms Instagram and <e2>Tumblr</e2> instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address.
, IMEI, device ID, manufacturer, model and phone number), location information, contacts stored, and call logs Collect and send SMS Take pictures via the camera Upload recorded MP4 files Monitor calls Searching further, we also found another sample that could be the second version of <e1>Project Spy</e1>. This version appeared as <e2>Wabi Music</e2>, and copied a popular video-sharing social networking service as its backend login page.
But once <e2>DualToy</e2> is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called <e1>adb.exe,</e1> which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients.
Mobile <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> The following table shows meta information on the observed samples, including compiler timestamps: MD5 Package Compiler C2 <e1>51df2597faa3fce38a4c5ae024f97b1c</e1> com.
This variant abuses Instagram and Tumblr profiles to hide its C&C server. <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0 targets <e2>South Korean</e2> Android users.
<e1>XLoader</e1> Disguises as <e2>Android Apps</e2>, Has FakeSpy Links In previous attacks, XLoader posed as Facebook, Chrome and other legitimate applications to trick users into downloading its malicious app.
<e1>Skygofree</e1>: Following in the footsteps of HackingTeam At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. We observed many web landing pages that mimic the sites of mobile operators and which are used to spread the <e2>Android</e2> implants.
At the beginning of July 2019, the experts spotted a threat actor dubbed mobeebom that was offering for sale an <e2>Android</e2> Remote Administration Tool (RAT) dubbed <e1>MobiHok</e1> v4 on a prominent English hacking forum.
It sends all of this data to the C2 server using the URL ending with /servlet/AppInfos. <e2>FakeSpy</e2> is able to check the network connectivity status by using the function isNetworkAvailable. What makes this function more suspicious is the two strings written in Chinese characters: ===状态=== (===Status===) - Checks whether the device is connected to a network <e1>===类型=== (===Type===)</e1> - Checks whether the device sees available nearby Wifi networks ANTI-EMULATOR TECHNIQUES FakeSpy appears to use multiple techniques to evade detection via the emulator.
For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “/[number]” (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. In this version of Rotexy, dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used. 2016 From mid-2016 on, the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains. No other significant changes were observed in the Trojan’s network behavior. In late 2016, versions of the Trojan emerged that contained the <e1>card.html</e1> phishing page in the assets/www folder.
The newly uncovered banking <e1>Alien</e1> trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials! When it has infected a device, the RAT tries to take passwords from at least 226 mobile applications; including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking & Capital One Mobile, as well as many collaboration & social apps e.g. Snapchat, Telegram & Microsoft Outlook. Underground Forums The malware, which was 1st advertised for rent on underground forums in Jan., has actively targeted institutions globally, including <e2>Australia</e2>, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the UK & the US.
It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). <e1>APT-C-23</e1> is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the <e2>Middle East</e2> with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones.
Here are some of the features of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

On February 14 2019 for the first time an <e1>Anubis</e1> sample seen targeting <e2>Russian banks</e2> only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator).
<e1>Pegasus</e1> For <e2>Android</e2>: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, Lookout and Google are releasing research into the Android version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: Pegasus.
It had again cloned a different legitimate <e2>Japanese website</e2> to host its malicious app, similar to what <e1>FakeSpy</e1> had also done before.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India <e2>Ireland</e2> Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e2>DualToy</e2> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example, for a 64-bit Windows PC, “AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi” and <e1>“AppleApplicationSupport64.msi”</e1> will be downloaded.
” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, <e1>cacamadf</e1>, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.
” In several Android samples of <e1>Monokle</e1>, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the <e2>Android</e2> client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco <e2>Netherlands</e2> New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise <e2>Exodus</e2> One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 <e1>34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba</e1> 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b Exodus One Package Names com.
In addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, <e1>DualToy</e1> also performs the following activities on Android and <e2>iOS</e2> devices: Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like AceDeceiver) Several years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to pair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy.
As the team at Scandinavian security group CSIS describes, malware known as <e1>MazarBOT</e1> is being distributed via SMS in Denmark and is likely to also be encountered in other countries. Victims’ first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their Android smartphone receives. The txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable Android application. CSIS provided a (sanitised) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for: “You have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link http://www.mmsforyou[.]net/mms.apk to view the message” Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their <e2>Android</e2> device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, MazarBOT downloads a copy of Tor onto users’ Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim’s location to an Iranian mobile phone number.
Previously in 2015, we saw the <e1>Rootnik</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access.
We labeled this new variant <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0, because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in <e2>Instagram</e2> and Tumblr profiles.
Previously in 2015, we saw the Rootnik Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file <e1>/data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip</e1> which contains all the rooting exploits.
Later the malware using local SQLite database, to store the data that harvested from infected mobile and an information about C&C servers. “<e2>Rotexy</e2> intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C. Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 <e1>reqsmscal.php</e1> Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.

Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. <e1>APT-C-23</e1> has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, <e2>Israel</e2>, Palestinian Territories and Egypt.
Exodus: New Android Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named <e1>Exodus</e1>, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two. We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as <e2>service applications</e2> from mobile operators.
In addition to found in traditional <e2>Windows</e2> PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, <e1>DualToy</e1> also performs the following activities on Android and iOS devices: Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like AceDeceiver) Several years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to pair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy.
The app, named <e2>Dardesh</e2>, posed as a chat application and acted as a downloader for a second app that could spy on users. The Dardesh app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. How was the app delivered to targets?
According to Wandera, the criminals had targeted victims working at several“Big Four” consultancy firms. “<e1>RedDrop</e1> is one of the most sophisticated pieces of Android malware that we have seen in broad distribution,” said Wandera in an overview of its research published Wednesday. “Not only does the attacker utilize a wide range of functioning malicious applications to entice the victim, they’ve also perfected every tiny detail to ensure their actions are difficult to trace.” Wandera told Threatpost it’s unsure how many <e2>Android</e2> devices may be infected with the malware.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos <e2>McAfee</e2> F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable.
Another example of <e2>FakeSpy</e2>’s anti-emulation techniques is how it uses the <e1>getMachine</e1> function, which uses the TelephonyManager class to check for the deviceID, phone number, IMEI, and IMSI.
But new data published today by Citizen Lab researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the <e1>Pegasus</e1> spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the <e2>UK</e2>, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app <e1>“com.qualcmm.timeservices.”</e1> These archives contain the file “.
But more recent variants of <e2>DualToy</e2> drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers <e1>AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi</e1> and AppleApplicationSupport64.

An in-depth analysis of <e1>SpyNote</e1> remote access trojan Find out what a remote access trojan (RAT) is and see how it can affect its victims' devices. Lookout researchers have recently discovered a surveillance campaign targeting Syrian citizens and it is believed that the actor behind the attack was state-sponsored. The campaign had been active since January 2018 and its goal was to infect Android mobile devices with remote access trojans (RATs) and then spy on people in possession of those devices. The victims were tricked into downloading and installing innocent-looking mobile applications which were actually spyware. The applications were shared through various communication channels; however, they were never available on the official Google Play Store. Some applications attempted to masquerade as legitimate ones like Telegram, others were <e2>COVID-19 contact tracing apps</e2> or benign tools like a fake digital thermometer, and others impersonated Android built-in tools.
The <e1>Alien</e1> RAT service implements the following set of commands: Command Description rat_disconnect Disables the RAT service open_folder Lists files and subfolders in the specified folder uploadind_file Uploads the specified file to the C2 connect_teamviewer Provides credentials for the TeamViewer app and launches it open_team_viewer Launches the TeamViewer app send_settings Sends the current settings of RAT service to the C2 get_apps Gets the list of installed applications on the infected device After using the Trojan’s commands to install additional apps on the device, <e2>TeamViewer</e2> is installed but not yet enabled.
Dubbed <e1>Skygofree</e1>, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.” Surveillance capabilities Although the Android malware has numerous creepy spying capabilities, 48 different commands in the latest implant, Kaspersky described the “geofence” command as one of the most notable features. A location can be specified so that when the victim’s device matches that location, “the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.” The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured. Kaspersky gives examples of how it steals Facebook data, Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, <e2>Viber</e2> and LINE for free calls and messages.
A, respectively). <e1>Project Spy</e1> uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates. We also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app after further investigation. However, we have noted a significantly small number of downloads of the app in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2>, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia.
Their similarity is made more apparent by looking at their naming method for downloadable files, domain structure of fake websites and other details of their deployment techniques, exemplified in figure 10. <e1>XLoader</e1> 6.0 also mirrors the way FakeSpy hides its real C&C server. When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the <e2>Twitter</e2> platform, something FakeSpy has done in its past attacks.
Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities <e1>Razdel</e1> (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target <e2>Central European banks</e2>, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e2>DualToy</e2> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, <e1>insapp.dll</e1> is the module used to infect an iOS device.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner. All have now been removed from Google Play, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that Facebook and YouTube pages advertising some of them were still up. If you install one of these innocent-looking apps, it collects information about your device and your surroundings, but otherwise does nothing terrible. If the app didn't work well for its advertised purposes and you complained about it on Google Play, the malware operators would apologize and make improvements. "We estimate the number of victims in the tens of thousands for the current wave, and probably hundreds of thousands throughout the full 4-year period," Bitdefender wrote in its report. But the first stage would also tricked you into authorizing app installations from outside the Google Play store, after which it would download and install the second stage — the "loader," which calls itself "<e2>Android</e2> system" to avoid attention.
Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1> suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, <e2>Google Play</e2>, lending the apps a level of credibility.

Fortunately for us, after a while topics showing interest in a certain “Alien” malware started to appear in the underground forum and the author himself confirmed his affiliation to, and the name of, the Trojan: Based on our in-depth knowledge of the Trojan (available in our Mobile Threat Intelligence portal), we can prove that the <e1>Alien</e1> malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early January 2020 and rented out at the same time as <e2>Cerberus</e2>. Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters.

Cerberus Banking Trojan: Features According to security researchers at ThreatFabric who analyzed a sample of Cerberus Trojan, the malware has a pretty common list of features, like: taking screenshots recording audio recording keylogs sending, receiving, and deleting SMSes, stealing contact lists forwarding calls collecting device information Tracking device location stealing account credentials, disabling Play Protect downloading additional apps and payloads removing apps from the infected device pushing notifications locking device's screen Once infected, <e1>Cerberus</e1> first hides its icon from the application drawer and then asks for the accessibility permission by masquerading itself as <e2>Flash Player Service</e2>. If granted, the malware automatically registers the compromised device to its command-and-control server, allowing the buyer/attacker to control the device remotely.
After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on Google Play), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: <e1>RCS Android</e1> (Remote Control System Android). Unsurprisingly, it can do so many things and spy on so many levels that they consider it the most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The spyware is delivered either via the aforementioned app, or via an SMS or email that contain a specially crafted URL that will trigger exploits for several vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to <e2>4.3 Jelly Bean</e2>. This will allow the attacker to gain root privilege, and allow the installation of a shell backdoor and RCS Android.
<e1>Anubis</e1> Android banking malware returns with extensive <e2>financial app</e2> hit list Thousands of new samples are targeting 188 banking and finance-related apps.
There are the following relevant detection paths (the last one is an alternative Telegram client – “<e2>Telegram</e2> X“): This would be a very unusual coincidence. Even when a false flag might also be a possibility, we consider this to be unlikely. The samples sharing this overlap are modified versions of an open source Jabber/XMPP client called “Conversations” with some code additions. The legitimate version of this app is also available on Google Play. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.
A malicious Android app has been uncovered on the Google Play app marketplace that is distributing the banking trojan, <e1>Cerberus</e1>. The app has 10,000 downloads. Researchers said that the trojan was found within the last few days, as it was being spread via a Spanish currency converter app (called “<e2>Calculadora de Moneda</e2>”), which has been available to Android users in Spain since March.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, <e2>Telegram</e2>, and BlackBerry Messenger.

According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the <e2>U.S.</e2> reported the second largest attacks (17.
Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the <e2>U.S</e2>, U.
Rotexy. <e1>Rotexy</e1>’s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of antivirus or banking applications). The most current version can block the devices’ screen to perform either ransomware or phishing functions. The New Attack Process The most current version of the trojan spreads via links sent in phishing SMSs that prompt the user to install an app. As it launches, the app requests device administrator rights, and then starts communicating with its C&C server. When first launching, the trojan checks to make sure the victim’s device is located in Russia and that it isn’t an emulator used by security researchers to spot malware. If the device checks out, the trojan registers with the mobile notification service <e2>Google Cloud Messaging</e2> and launches a service to check if the trojan has device administrator privileges, according researchers.
DualToy Windows Trojan Attacks Android, iOS Devices Researchers have found a malware family called <e1>DualToy</e1> that infects Windows PCs and sideloads malware onto connected Android and <e2>iOS</e2> devices.
PackageManager” (the Android package manager to remove its own icon on the home screen in order to conceal the existence of <e2>RuMMS</e2> from the user: setComponentEnabledSetting(MainActivity.class, 2, 1) At the same time, ”org.starsizew.MainActivity” will start the main service as defined in “org.starsizew.Tb”, and use a few mechanisms to keep the main service running continuously in the background. The class “org.starsizew.Ac” is designed for this purpose; its only task is to check if the main service is running, and restart the main service if the answer is no. The class “org.starsizew.Tb” also has a self-monitoring mechanism to restart itself when its own onDestroy API is triggered. Other than that, its major functionality is to collect private device information, upload it to a remote C2 server, and handle any commands as requested by the C2 server. All those functions are implemented in asynchronous tasks by <e1>“org.starsizew.i”.</e1> The class “org.
The <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile <e2>Android</e2> devices belonging to Israeli citizens.
When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in <e2>Android</e2> devices.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 <e1>bannerincbest[.]com</e1> 102 7 campuphome[.
This malware works same as the <e1>Flu Bot</e1> threat which is still out there in the United Kingdom as well as in <e2>Europe</e2>. Just like the name Tangle, this malware can mislead the target to install the tampered software received by a forged Covid-19 alert.

All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and <e1>Game644.res,</e1> are used in the main phase.

This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user’s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols. Push notifications were also used to control audio recording. Lookout has shared information about this family with Apple, and they have revoked the affected certificates. As a result, no new instances of this app can be installed on <e2>iOS</e2> devices and existing installations can no longer be run.
According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising <e1>Pegasus</e1> as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including <e2>Google Drive</e2>, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history.
Once fully installed, <e1>Exodus</e1> was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from <e2>Chrome</e2> and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.

In the Android version, however, the attackers built in functionality that would allow <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>Android</e2> to still ask for permissions that would then allow it to access and exfiltrate data.
Volexity refers to this implant by the name <e2>INSOMNIA</e2>. Volexity observed multiple different attacks where this implant was being installed on iOS devices. This includes six different exploit websites; five instances of the malware implant; three different C2 IP and port pair combination; and two unique C2 IP addresses. Each of the observed exploit sites and malware C2 servers are detailed in Appendix A below. Targeting Website Visitors The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites. Volexity observed a total of six different hostnames being used to launch attacks between January and March 2020. While the first round of attacks were identified across several websites, future attacks were only observed in conjunction with the Uyghur Academy website. The attacks were largely loaded in fairly standard ways, such as via an iframe on a website's index, a modified JavaScript file used by the website, or nested iframes—which was the case on the Uyghur Academy website. The code below has been on the main index of the Uyghur Academy website for several months. The <e1>"JPlayer.html"</e1> file appears to be exclusively used by the Evil Eye actor when they want to launch attacks against visitors to the website.

The <e1>Exodus</e1>-infected iOS apps were signed with Apple-issued enterprise certificates, which allowed victims to install the malicious apps, even from outside the App Store. Apple eventually revoked these certificates. Bauer said that compared to the Android version, which had been under development for at least five years, the iOS variant was far less sophisticated, suggesting it was a newer project. It could only collect and steal contacts, photos, videos, audio recordings, GPS information, and device location. It could also perform on-demand audio recording operations, however, it was nowhere near as intrusive and did not the same level of control of infected devices as the Android variant. The links between the two versions were also undeniable, as besides finding the iOS variant on the same server infrastructure as payloads used by the Android version, the <e2>iOS</e2> variant also uploaded stolen data to the same exiltration server, and used a similar protocol.
However, it’s the Trojan displaying the form, not Google Play — and the input data goes straight to the cybercriminals. <e1>Ginp</e1> goes beyond the <e2>Play Store</e2>, also showing what appear to be notifications from banking apps: Curiously, the fake notifications provide a real phone number for the bank, so if you call, the voice at the end of the line is likely to report that your account is fine.
Geography of Rotexy attacks According to our data, 98% of all <e1>Rotexy</e1> attacks target users in Russia. Indeed, the Trojan explicitly targets Russian-speaking users. There have also been cases of users in Ukraine, <e2>Germany</e2>, Turkey and several other countries being affected.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages 3 <e1>reqcalllog.php</e1> Upload specified file from the device to the C2 4 reqcalllog.

<e1>ViceLeaker</e1> Operation: mobile espionage targeting <e2>Middle East</e2> In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens.
This local port is used by <e1>Exodus</e1> Two to execute various commands on the <e2>Android</e2> device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases.
The Check Point Research Team explained the revenue model for attackers as follows: “Ad servers, which don’t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send <e1>Gooligan</e1> the names of the apps to download from Google Play. “After an app is installed, the ad service pays the attacker. “Then the malware leaves a positive review and a high rating on <e2>Google Play</e2> using content it receives from the C&C server.
After that, the <e1>Ginp</e1> author borrowed code from the <e2>Anubis</e2> malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year.
The full capabilities of <e1>Mandrake</e1> – which has been observed targeting users across <e2>Europe</e2> and the Americas – are detailed in a paper by cybersecurity researchers at Bitdefender.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted <e2>social media</e2> and banking apps.
A new <e2>Android</e2> malware has appeared in the threat landscape, tracked as <e1>MobiHok</e1> RAT, it borrows the code from the old SpyNote RAT.
The newly identified malware, known as <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in <e2>Palestine</e2>. A similar 2017 campaign from the same “highly active” group, dubbed APT-C-23.
An analysis of the <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to <e2>Google Play</e2>, said Blaich.

]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and <e2>Office Scanner</e2>. All have now been removed from Google Play, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that Facebook and YouTube pages advertising some of them were still up.
<e1>Mandrake</e1> - owning Android devices since 2016 In early 2020 we identified a new, highly sophisticated <e2>Android</e2> espionage platform that had been active in the wild for at least 4 years.
Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. <e1>Monokle</e1> supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, <e2>Viber,</e2> Skype, and Snapchat.

Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as <e1>Ghost Push</e1> that <e2>Google</e2> has been fighting in earnest for the last year.
Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, <e2>Threema</e2> and Telegram.

The class “org.starsizew.Ac” is designed for this purpose; its only task is to check if the main service is running, and restart the main service if the answer is no. The class “org.starsizew.Tb” also has a self-monitoring mechanism to restart itself when its own onDestroy API is triggered. Other than that, its major functionality is to collect private device information, upload it to a remote C2 server, and handle any commands as requested by the C2 server. All those functions are implemented in asynchronous tasks by “org.starsizew.i”. The class <e1>“org.starsizew.Ma”</e1> is registered to intercept incoming SMS messages, the arrival of which will trigger the Android system to call its “onReceive” API.

A few months later in September 2019, security firm Buguroo revealed that it had detected a new version of <e1>Cerberus</e1> targeting Spanish and <e2>Latin American</e2> entities.
After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and <e2>Hong Kong</e2>. XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang.
They should first review the permissions requested, as only the malicious version containing <e1>DroidJack</e1> requests the ability to modify SMS messages and record audio. Players can also check the SHA256 hash of the downloaded APK to see if it matches that of the real <e2>Pokémon GO</e2> app.
XLoader: A deep insight into the Android malware’s various campaigns <e1>XLoader</e1> was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or <e2>Chrome</e2> apps.
We used a sample app named <e2>“org.starsizew”</e2> with an MD5 of <e1>d8caad151e07025fdbf5f3c26e3ceaff</e1> to analyze RuMMS’s code.
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted <e2>South Korean</e2> and Japanese speakers.
Dubbed "<e1>Pegasus</e1>," the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a <e2>memory corruption flaw</e2> in Safari WebKit.
png’, a suspiciously large file that matched many of the traits seen in <e2>HummingBad</e2>, indicating the link between <e1>HummingWhale</e1> and its predecessor.
Called “<e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1>”, the banking trojan was available on Google Play at the time of the analysis. The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however, this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable <e2>Android</e2>’s Accessibility Service – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality.
” New <e2>Anubis</e2> Tricks Once downloaded on the device, the banking trojan makes a connection with the command-and-control (C2) server and downloads another application to initiate the SOCKS5 proxy. “This proxy allows the attacker to enforce authentication for clients communicating with their server and mask communications between the client and C2. Once retrieved and decrypted, the APK is saved as ‘FR.apk’ in ‘<e1>/data/data/fr.orange.serviceapp/app_apk</e1>,'” the researchers wrote.
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted South Korean and Japanese speakers. However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, <e2>United States</e2>, and others.
In a recent analysis, our team found that an <e1>Ursnif</e1> (aka <e2>Gozi</e2>) banking Trojan variant is being used in the wild to target online banking users in Italy with mobile malware.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the <e2>UK</e2>, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy.
Dubbed ViceLeaker; researchers claim that it is the product of a group of hackers that is specifically targeting Middle Eastern and Israeli citizens. <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> campaign utilizes the notorious surveillance malware called Triout, and Kaspersky researchers detected it for the first time in May 2018. It is worth noting that Bitdefender also reported about the campaign in one of their recent blog posts, therefore, Kaspersky isn’t the only firm to have detected the malware campaign. Initial analysis revealed that hackers were targeting “dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to <e2>Israeli</e2> citizens.
Warning As Devious New Android Malware Hides In Fake Adobe Flash Player Installations (Updated) Millions of Android users are being warned about a devious new banking trojan, dubbed <e1>Cerberus</e1>, that infects devices by masquerading as an <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2> installation.
The so-called <e1>ViperRAT</e1> malware was incorporated into two apps, and it has previously targeted members of the <e2>Israeli Defense Force</e2>. Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. <e2>Royal Mail</e2> - British postal service and courier company.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 <e1>vietusprotus[.]com</e1> 50 3 glowbobget[.
But once <e1>DualToy</e1> is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on <e2>Windows</e2> clients.
The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the <e1>FrozenCell</e1> family attributed to <e2>APT-C-27</e2>. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.
However, it is possible that set of command change in future for <e1>Rotexy</e1> Trojan. Also, As per Kaspersky 98% users are targeted in Russia only rest few cases have seen in <e2>Ukraine</e2>, Turkey, Germany, and a few other countries.
“To conclude, despite <e2>mobeebom</e2>’s attempt to market his <e1>MobiHok</e1> v4 Android RAT as new and his declared intention to make it the top Android RAT on the market, it appears that this malware is based on the leaked source code of the known SpyNote Android RAT with only minor changes and is being reselled by the threat actor under a different name.
This will allow the attackers to: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Our team has identified the malicious APK to be the <e2>Mazar Android BOT</e2>, a threat also that Recorded Future spotted in November 2015. The malicious packet (APK) retrieves TOR and installs it on the victim’s phone via the following harmless URLs: <e1>https: //f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android</e1> https: //play.
In the past, <e2>XLoader</e2> showed the ability to mine cryptocurrency on PCs and perform account phishing on iOS devices. This new wave also presents unique attack vectors based on the kind of device it has accessed. In the case of Android devices, accessing the malicious website or pressing any of the buttons will prompt the download of the APK. However, successfully installing this malicious APK requires that the user has allowed the installation of such apps as controlled in the Unknown Sources settings. If users allow such apps to be installed, then it can be actively installed on the victim’s device. The infection chain is slightly more roundabout in the case of Apple devices. Accessing the same malicious site would redirect its user to another malicious website (hxxp://apple-icloud[.]qwq-japan[.]com or <e1>hxxp://apple-icloud[.]zqo-japan[.]com)</e1> that prompts the user to install a malicious iOS configuration profile to solve a network issue preventing the site to load.
1 via the <e2>Apple Safari</e2>, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge mobile browsers. If a visiting device passes the first checks put in place by Evil Eye, code similar to the following would be returned: The file jquery.js contains the main logic and the server's public key, while the file s.js contains the supporting Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library used to generate a client key pair. This client public key is passed as a variable into the loading of the final JavaScript. If each step of the JavaScript above is successful, it results in a Mach-O binary running on the phone. This application contains an iOS exploit for the targeted version and another Mach-O binary, the <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> implant, embedded in it.
The attack campaign, named <e1>Gooligan</e1>, breached the security of over one million Google accounts. The number continues to rise at an additional 13,000 breached devices each day. Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from <e2>Google Play</e2>, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, Google Drive, and more.
In this blog post, we describe <e1>Chrysaor</e1>, a newly discovered family of spyware that was used in a targeted attack on a small number of <e2>Android</e2> devices, and how investigations like this help Google protect Android users from a variety of threats.
The use of a specific certificate and SSL verification means that the malware will not talk to just any listening HTTPS server, which adds complexity to analyzing <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> in a sandbox environment. To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to "trick" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified. Functionality & Targeted Applications As described in the Project Zero and CitizenLab posts, the malware contains a list of applications for which it will steal data automatically if they are installed. Since the last analysis, the following applications have been added to this list: Signal (org.whispersystems.signal) <e2>ProtonMail</e2> (ch.
<e1>DualToy</e1>: New Windows Trojan Sideloads Risky Apps to Android and <e2>iOS</e2> Devices Over the past two years, we’ve observed many cases of Microsoft Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices.

<e1>Ursnif</e1> Leverages Cerberus to Automate Fraudulent Bank Transfers in <e2>Italy</e2> June 23, 2021 IBM Trusteer researchers continually monitor the evolution and attack tactics in the banking sector.
Examples of modern families based on <e2>Marcher</e2> are: <e1>ExoBot</e1> Gustuff DiseaseBot Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. Port 6209: Telegram extraction service. Port 6210: SBrowser extraction service. <e1>Port 6211</e1>: Calendar extraction service.
Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group APT-C-23, also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and <e2>Telegram</e2>. The malware, Android/SpyC32.
One module is used to exfiltrate Skype call recordings, but other capabilities include keylogging, turning on the mic to record audio, capturing screenshots and exfiltrating data. <e1>Skygofree</e1> wasn’t created from scratch as Kaspersky noted “it looks like the attackers created this exploit payload based on android-rooting-tools project source code.” In another instance, the researchers “found some code similarities between the implant for Windows and other public accessible projects. It appears the developers have copied the functional part of the keylogger module from this project.” How victims are infected This spyware is being used for targeted surveillance; all known targets have been located in <e2>Italy</e2>. Victims are infected after being lured to visit specific malicious sites meant to look like those of mobile operators.

An Android malware called <e1>TangleBot</e1> has weaved its way onto the cyber-scene: One that researchers said can perform a bouquet of malicious actions, including stealing personal info and controlling apps and device functions. According to Cloudmark researchers, the newly discovered mobile malware is spreading via SMS messaging in the <e2>U.S.</e2> and Canada, using lures about COVID-19 boosters and regulations.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices.

apk” is a variant of the <e2>Cerberus</e2> banking trojan. They are usually spread via phishing campaigns. Corona-Apps.apk uses its connection with the actual virus name to trick users into installing it on their smartphones. Dynamic Analysis of Cerberus By Bogdan Anghelache, specialist threat researcher, Avira Protection Labs Behavior upon installation <e1>Corona-Apps.apk</e1> variant has a very aggressive behavior after installation.
The collected information includes: Device name, type, version and model number Device UUID and serial number Device baseband version, system build version, and firmware version Device IMEI SIM card’s IMSI and ICCID Phone number Download and install app In addition to collecting device information, <e2>DualToy</e2> also tries to download IPA file(s) from the C2 server and install them on the connected iOS device. The URL it used to fetch the downloading list is http://www.zaccl[.]com/tool/apple/wj_app.xml. During our analysis in April and in August 2016, this URL always returned a single file, <e1>“kuaiyong.ipa”.</e1> After downloading it, DualToy will copy the IPA file via the AFC service to the iOS device’s /var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging directory, and then install it via the installation_proxy service.
Commands can either tell <e1>Twitoor</e1> to download and install other applications — generally of the data-stealing mobile banking malware variety — or switch to another command-and-control Twitter account. “Using Twitter instead of command-and-control servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” said Lukas Stefanko, the ESET malware researcher who first found the app. Apparently, it’s been around for about a month, and while it can’t be downloaded from the Google Play store, experts think that devices are infected either with text messages or malicious URLs. The use of social media networks in the botnet’s communication is rather creative, Stefanko admits, noting, “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely.” He added, “In the future, we can expect that the bad guys will try to make use of Facebook statuses or deploy LinkedIn and other social networks.” So proceed with great caution, friends. Your Android could indeed be controlled by a rogue <e2>Twitter</e2> account.
Infecting Android Devices Almost all samples of <e2>DualToy</e2> are capable of infecting Android devices connected with the compromised Windows PC via USB cable. This functionality is usually implemented in a module named <e1>NewPhone.dll,</e1> DevApi.

To launch its fraudulent transaction flow, <e1>Ursnif</e1> needs to start a function that would be clicked by the infected victim. It, therefore, attempts to replace a login button from the original bank’s webpage and plant its own button that the victim will click. The function launched is named ‘hookPay()’: The function being used to swap the IBAN and plan the transaction parameters is called ‘makeTrf()’. The amount being transferred is set to move forward if the account’s balance is higher than €3,000.

<e1>ViceLeaker</e1> <e2>Android</e2> spyware targets users in the Middle East Experts at Kaspersky have uncovered a spyware campaign dubbed ViceLeaker that spreads in the Middle East to spy on Android users.
Who is affected? <e1>Gooligan</e1> potentially affects devices on Android 4 (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5 (Lollipop), which is over 74% of in-market devices today. About 57% of these devices are located in Asia and about 9% are in <e2>Europe</e2>. In our research we identified tens of fake applications that were infected with this malware.
Throughout 2017, many actors used <e2>Bankbot</e2> for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks <e1>MysteryBot</e1> (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong <e2>India</e2> Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
<e1>Anubis</e1> Strikes Again: Mobile Malware Continues to Plague Users in <e2>Official App Stores</e2> IBM X-Force mobile malware researchers have observed several developers actively uploading Android malware downloaders to the Google Play Store.
The second <e1>Project Spy</e1> version has similar capabilities to the first version, with the addition of the following: Stealing notification messages sent from WhatsApp, <e2>Facebook</e2>, and Telegram Abandoning the FTP mode of uploading the recorded images Aside from changing the app’s supposed function and look, the second and third versions’ codes had little differences.
]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

myPid ()); Until now, <e1>Mazar BOT</e1> has been advertised for sale on several websites on the Dark Web, but this is the first time we’ve seen this code be abused in active attacks. Attackers may be testing this new type of Android malware to see how they can improve their tactics and reach their final goals, which probably is making more money (as always). We can expect this malware to expand its reach, also because of its ability to remain covert by using <e2>TOR</e2> to hide its communication.
Bitdefender researchers have identified a new <e2>Android</e2> spyware, dubbed <e1>Triout</e1>, which appears to act as a framework for building extensive surveillance capabilities into seemingly benign applications.

As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, Germany, United States of America, <e2>Italy</e2>, France, Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, <e1>Mandrake</e1> won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. For unknown reasons, it also avoids installing itself on phones with Verizon SIM cards, or SIM cards from a top Chinese cellular carrier. Its primary target appears to be Australia, followed by North America, western Europe (and <e2>Poland</e2>) and some of the richer parts of South America.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, <e2>Mexico</e2>, Turkey, the UAE, and others.

After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others.

But <e1>Ginp</e1>’s authors did not stop there, repeatedly replenishing its arsenal with more inventive capabilities. For instance, the malware started using push notifications and pop-up messages to get the victim to open certain apps — those that it can overlay with phishing windows. The notifications are cleverly worded to lull the user into expecting to see a form for entering bank card data. Below is an example (in Spanish): Google Pay: Nos faltan los detalles de su tarjeta de crédito o débito. Utilice Play Store para agregarlos de manera segura. (“Google Pay: We are missing your credit or debit card details. Please use the Play Store app to add them securely.”) In the <e2>Play Store</e2> app, users see a form for entering card data as expected.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. <e2>Deutsche Post</e2> - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn.

Their similarity is made more apparent by looking at their naming method for downloadable files, domain structure of fake websites and other details of their deployment techniques, exemplified in figure 10. <e1>XLoader</e1> 6.0 also mirrors the way FakeSpy hides its real C&C server. When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the Twitter platform, something FakeSpy has done in its past attacks. Analysis of the malicious <e2>iOS</e2> profile also revealed further connections, as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that FakeSpy deployed early this year.
Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average <e1>Anubis</e1> sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in <e2>Europe</e2>, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.
Zero-Click <e2>Apple</e2> Zero-Day Uncovered in <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spy Attack The phones of 36 journalists were infected by four APTs, possibly linked to Saudi Arabia or the UAE.
Along with the malicious <e2>DEFENSOR ID</e2> app, another malicious app named Defensor Digital was discovered. Both apps shared the same C&C server, but we couldn’t investigate the latter as it had already been removed from the Google Play store.

The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main <e2>XMPP</e2> host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, <e2>Spain</e2>, Switzerland, and Italy.
" While <e1>Monokle</e1> currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses <e2>Armenia</e2>, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria.

dll. <e2>DualToy</e2> assumes ADB is enabled on the connected Android device. If ADB isn't enabled (which is the default option), the . However, some users, especially those who want to install Android apps from a PC or Mac, or who want to do advanced operations with their Android devices, This is because ADB is both the only official interface for a Windows or Mac computer to operate an Android device via USB and it is a debugging interface. Install ADB drivers Once loaded, the module will first download universal Windows ADB drivers from its C2 server (e.g., from http[:]//www.zaccl.com/tool/new_tool.zip) and install them. Then, some variants will directly drop a file named adb.exe which is the standard ADB Windows client. Other variants have compiled the ADB client’s source code into the module so that they could also perform ADB operations. Instead of <e1>adb.exe,</e1> the newest variant will drop tadb.

Detailed Technical Analysis Service Launching and Configuration After installed on an Android device, <e2>SpyDealer</e2> shows no application icon. However, it registers two broadcast receivers to listen for events related to the device booting up and network connection status. Whenever any of these events are broadcasted, the key service component AaTService starts. At the first launch, it retrieves configuration information from the local asset file named readme.txt. The first line of this file indicates the IP address of a remote C2 server, the second line configures what actions the malware can take on mobile networks, and the third line specifies what actions are allowed under a Wi-Fi network. The configuration settings can also be remotely updated by various C2 channels. One example of the <e1>readme.txt</e1> is given in Figure 2.
“The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that <e1>mobeebom</e1> probably obtained <e2>SpyNote</e2>’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. <e1>Ports 6203 and 6204</e1>: Facebook extraction service.
We called these three “Trident.” <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>Android</e2> does not require zero-day vulnerabilities to root the target device and install the malware.
Ongoing activity While monitoring this particular threat, we found another <e1>XLoader</e1> variant posing as a pornography app aimed at South Korean users. The "porn kr sex" APK connects to a malicious website that runs XLoader in the background. The website uses a different fixed twitter account (https://twitter.com/fdgoer343). This attack, however, seems exclusive to <e2>Android</e2> users, as it does not have the code to attack iOS devices.
In this particular example they were set as follows: Android applications, including malware, can listen for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast event to ensure the application will be activated upon device start up, and this is the technique that <e2>SpyNote</e2> utilizes to achieve its persistence mechanism. As per the AndroidManifest.xml file, the class that is receiving the BOOT_COMPLETED event is com.android.tester.C4: This class waits for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, checks if the <e1>com.android.tester.C11</e1> service is already running, and, if not, initiates it.

It’s interesting that <e2>Triout</e2>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from Israel. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample. A subsequent investigation revealed that the spyware has the following capabilities: Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php) Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php) Has capability to hide self Can send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.php) Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C (uppc.php, fi npic.php <e1>orreqpic.php)</e1> Can send GPS coordinates to C&C (gps3.

All have now been removed from Google Play, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that Facebook and <e2>YouTube</e2> pages advertising some of them were still up.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, <e2>Skype</e2>, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.
As the team at Scandinavian security group CSIS describes, malware known as <e2>MazarBOT</e2> is being distributed via SMS in Denmark and is likely to also be encountered in other countries. Victims’ first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their Android smartphone receives. The txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable Android application. CSIS provided a (sanitised) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for: “You have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link <e1>http://www.mmsforyou[.]net/mms.apk</e1> to view the message” Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, MazarBOT downloads a copy of Tor onto users’ Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim’s location to an Iranian mobile phone number.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee <e2>F-Secure</e2> The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable.
The newly uncovered banking <e1>Alien</e1> trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials!

Capture real-time voice calls in any network or app by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> in the Wild Our analysis reveals that this RCSAndroid (AndroidOS_RCSAgent.HRX) has been in the wild since 2012. Traces of its previous uses in the wild were found inside the configuration file: It was configured to use a Command-and-control (C&C) server in the United States; however, the server was bought from a host service provider and is now unavailable. It was configured to activate via SMS sent from a Czech Republic number. Attackers can send SMS with certain messages to activate the agent and trigger corresponding action. This can also define what kind of evidences to collect. Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of Czech firms appear to be in business with the <e2>Hacking team</e2>, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games.
<e1>TrickBot</e1> Pushing a 2FA Bypass App to Bank Customers in <e2>Germany</e2> IBM X-Force researchers analyzed an Android malware app that’s likely being pushed to infected users by the TrickBot Trojan.
The Android app, called "<e1>TrickMo</e1>" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted <e2>German</e2> users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware.
The latest version of <e1>Rotexy</e1> targeted mostly users located in Russia, although Kaspersky noticed victims in <e2>Ukraine</e2>, Germany, Turkey, and several other countries as well.
This will allow the attackers to: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Our team has identified the malicious APK to be the <e1>Mazar Android BOT</e1>, a threat also that Recorded Future spotted in November 2015. The malicious packet (APK) retrieves TOR and installs it on the victim’s phone via the following harmless URLs: https: //f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android https: //play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android In the next phase of the attack, the infection will unpack and run the TOR application, which will then be used to connect to the following server: http: // pc35hiptpcwqezgs [.] Onion. After that, an automated SMS will be sent to the number 9876543210 (+98 is the country code for Iran) with the text message: “Thank you”. The catch is that this SMS also includes the device’s location data. Insidious mobile malware with crippling options This specific mobile malware opens the doors to all kinds of malicious consequences for the victim. Attackers can: Open a backdoor into Android smartphones, to monitor and control them as they please; Send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, seriously increasing the victim’s phone bill; Read SMS messages, which means they can also read authentication codes sent as part of two-factor authentication mechanisms, used also by online banking apps and ecommerce websites; Use their full access to Android phones to basically manipulate the device to do whatever they want. And it gets worse. <e2>Polipo</e2> proxy and Man-in-the-Middle Attack The attackers behind Mazar BOT also implemented the “Polipo proxy“, which gives them additional access to even more Android functionalities.
It’s interesting that we can recover its original file name which is fb_mem_root. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 also gain root privilege thought another method that doesn’t use “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drop files including sux, getroot, logo.png and busybox_g1 from assets to the app’s own data directory.

SpyNote RAT is capable of performing a variety of alarming functions that includes: Activating the device’s microphone and listening to live conversations Executing commands on the device Copying files from the device to a Command & Control (C&C) center Recording screen captures Viewing contacts Reading SMS messages The screenshot below shows part of the sandbox’s report on the SpyNote RAT’s signature and detected functions: The fake Netflix app we are analyzing in this blog appears to be built using an updated version of <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> builder, which was leaked last year. Technical details Please note that our research is not about the legitimate <e2>Netflix</e2> app on Google Play.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, <e2>Viber</e2>, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.
The <e1>Exodus</e1>-infected iOS apps were signed with Apple-issued enterprise certificates, which allowed victims to install the malicious apps, even from outside the App Store. Apple eventually revoked these certificates. Bauer said that compared to the Android version, which had been under development for at least five years, the iOS variant was far less sophisticated, suggesting it was a newer project. It could only collect and steal contacts, photos, videos, audio recordings, GPS information, and device location. It could also perform on-demand audio recording operations, however, it was nowhere near as intrusive and did not the same level of control of infected devices as the Android variant. The links between the two versions were also undeniable, as besides finding the <e2>iOS</e2> variant on the same server infrastructure as payloads used by the Android version, the iOS variant also uploaded stolen data to the same exiltration server, and used a similar protocol.
0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘<e1>XLoader</e1> v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for <e2>Android</e2> devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.
After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, <e2>Korea</e2>, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
New SMS-based <e2>android</e2> malware, <e1>tangleBot</e1>, unleashed by cybercriminals — NCC The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), again, has been informed of a new high-risk, critical and Short Messaging Service-based malware, TangleBot, infecting Android mobile devices.
One such immediately apparent connection was the similar deployment technique used by both <e1>XLoader</e1> 6.0 and FakeSpy. It had again cloned a different legitimate <e2>Japanese website</e2> to host its malicious app, similar to what FakeSpy had also done before.

THREAT ANALYSIS Infection Vector: Smishing Your Device Thus far, <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a. smishing). These SMS messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the FakeSpy download. In a previous campaign reported by JPCERT, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and <e2>Transportation Services Companies</e2> One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world.

The <e1>HummingBad</e1> virus revealed in July of last year was one of the worst pieces of malware catalogued, infecting as many as 85m Android phones around the globe. Originating from a Chinese cyber-criminal gang called Yingmob, the security research company Check Point believed it was earning as much as $300,000 a month in fraudulent adware by establishing a persistent rootkit on <e2>Android</e2> devices.
0 banking malware, hackers start to plunder your account to make unauthorised purchases or money transfers, and your bank can’t get hold of you if they suspect something suspicious is occurring. <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> is said to work on phones running Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) and earlier. As always, you would be wise to be cautious of what apps you install on your Android device – particularly if they are sourced from unofficial app marketplaces. Whether they are breaking into social media profiles to post spam or raiding <e2>online bank accounts</e2> to steal money, criminals are dead-set on exploiting innocent people’s mobile devices to make money.
These encoded strings contain the new URL addresses not seen in older versions of <e1>FakeSpy</e1>. WHO IS BEHIND FAKESPY’S SMISHING CAMPAIGNS? The Cybereason Nocturnus team suspects that the malware operators and authors are Chinese speakers. Our findings, along with previous research, indicates that the threat actor behind these recent campaigns is likely a Chinese group dubbed “Roaming Mantis”. Roaming Mantis is believed to be a Chinese threat actor group first discovered in April 2018 that has continuously evolved. In the beginning, this threat group mainly targeted <e2>Asian countries</e2>. Now, they are expanding their activity to audiences all around the world.

CONNECTION TO <e2>CHINA</e2> Chinese server infrastructure: FakeSpy applications send stolen information to C2 domains with .
This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes. All the detections of this backdoored app were geolocated in Iran. Backdoored Conversations C2 server analysis During the analysis of the Smali injected apps and their C2 server infrastructure we hadn’t found any interesting clues, but things changed when we looked at the C2 server of the linked Conversations messenger. It uses <e1>“185.51.201[.]133”</e1> as a main C2 address, and there is only one domain that is hosted on this dedicated server – iliageram[.

On December 13 2018 <e2>maza-in</e2> announces the release of <e1>Anubis 2.5</e1>; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code.
Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by <e1>DualToy</e1> on <e2>iOS</e2> devices has expired, researchers said.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: google.servlce.store gooogle.services goooogle.services play.google.servlce.store <e1>play.gooogle.services</e1> play.
According to our research, <e1>TrickMo</e1> is still under active development as we expect to see frequent changes and updates. While it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region, at this time, we are seeing it deployed specifically in <e2>Germany</e2>. Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016.
Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the U.S, <e2>U.K</e2>, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, India and Italy, according to researchers.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, <e2>Kakoa</e2>, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.
In this particular example they were set as follows: Android applications, including malware, can listen for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast event to ensure the application will be activated upon device start up, and this is the technique that <e2>SpyNote</e2> utilizes to achieve its persistence mechanism. As per the AndroidManifest.xml file, the class that is receiving the BOOT_COMPLETED event is <e1>com.android.tester.C4:</e1> This class waits for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, checks if the com.
<e1>Dvmap</e1>: the first Android malware with code injection In April 2017 we started observing new rooting malware being distributed through the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>. Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries.
The newly identified malware, known as <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in Palestine. A similar 2017 campaign from the same “highly active” group, dubbed <e2>APT-C-23</e2>. The group has been linked to Hamas’s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students.
The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named <e1>FrozenCell</e1> - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called <e2>APT-C-23</e2> targeting individuals in the Middle East.
As the team at Scandinavian security group CSIS describes, malware known as <e1>MazarBOT</e1> is being distributed via SMS in Denmark and is likely to also be encountered in other countries. Victims’ first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their <e2>Android</e2> smartphone receives.
An overview of this entire chain is shown in the Figure below: <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> Implant Analysis Further analysis of the malicious binary indicates it appears to be an updated version of the implant described by Google's Project Zero in their Implant Teardown post, which was an updated version of what CitizenLab later described here. The differences and updates are summarized as follows: New hard-coded IP addresses and ports were found in the malware implants. All C2 communication is now done securely over HTTPS. This encrypts all C2 activity, to include data exfiltration. The malware conducts C2 server validation using a certificate embedded in the malware and will not function if validation fails. The malware employs basic obfuscation techniques to obscure some of its embedded strings. The encrypted messaging and secure e-mail applications <e2>Signal</e2> and Protonmail have been added to the list of apps that are specifically targeted by the malware.

” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, <e1>konkonq2</e1>, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.

exe file was compiled from ADB’s source code with some customizations -- <e2>DualToy</e2> will execute it with the command line “appdata.exe shell am start”. When invoked by this command line, the appdata.exe copies the guardmb file to connected Android device’s <e1>/data/local/tmp</e1> directory, and executes it.
XLoader distributed via DNS domains <e1>XLoader</e1> was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate <e2>Facebook</e2> or Chrome apps.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file <e1>“.root.sh”</e1> which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers. This trojan force users to enter only right credentials and it checks all the details against the data that it already received.

<e1>Mandrake</e1> - owning <e2>Android</e2> devices since 2016 In early 2020 we identified a new, highly sophisticated Android espionage platform that had been active in the wild for at least 4 years.
The campaign seeks to deliver Anubis, a particularly nasty piece of malware that was originally used for cyber espionage and retooled as a banking trojan. <e1>Anubis</e1> can completely hijack an Android mobile device, steal data, record phone calls, and even hold the device to ransom by encrypting the victim’s personal files. With mobile devices increasingly used in the corporate environment, thanks to the popularity of BYOD policies, this malware has the potential to cause serious harm, mostly to consumers, and businesses that allow the installation of unsigned applications. Here’s how it works: At first glance, the email shown in Figure 1 looks like any other phishing email that asks the user to download an invoice. However, this particular email downloads an Android Package Kit (APK), which is the common format used by Android to distribute and install applications. Let’s take a closer look at the suspicious file. When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file (Fattura002873.apk), is downloaded. Upon opening the file, the user is asked to enable “Google Play Protect” as shown in Figure 2. However, this is not a genuine “Google Play Protect” screen; instead it gives the app all the permissions it needs while simultaneously disabling the actual Google Play Protect. A closer look at the code reveals the application gathers a list of installed applications to compare the results against a list of targeted applications (Figure 4). The malware mainly targets banking and financial applications, but also looks for popular shopping apps such as <e2>eBay</e2> or Amazon.
After that, <e2>DualToy</e2> will execute <e1>“msiexec.exe”</e1> to install the installers shown in Figure 8 in background via the “/qn” parameter.
Here are some of the features of RCSAndroid include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger. <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> Android hacking tool had been in the wild since 2012 and has been known to Citizen Lab researchers since last year when the security firm detailed a Hacking Team backdoor used against Android users in <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2>.

Here too, the ‘Jambo’ word repeats throughout the function, calling into action the jQuery library that orchestrates the malware’s script-based activity. <e2>Cerberus</e2> is being used here only as the component that allows the attackers to bypass the bank’s SMS-code verification challenge. The fraudulent transaction itself takes place on the victims’ infected desktops (Windows-based devices). While most fraud is in-session using Gozi SOCK proxy capability, some access to the victim’s account came from other devices. Ursnif’s C2 Communications The basics of Ursnif’s command and control (C2) communications are also carried out through the same channels. <e1>Jambo.getScript</e1> sends information to srv_dom, which is the malware’s injection server in this case, used to manage the man-in-the-browser activity.
But once <e1>DualToy</e1> is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard <e2>Android Debug Bridge</e2> on Windows clients.

Worryingly, Wandera says that "<e1>RedDrop</e1> is one of the most sophisticated pieces of <e2>Android</e2> malware that we have seen in broad distribution.
In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including <e2>Bank of America</e2>, U.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise <e1>FakeSpy</e1> are country-specific, including: <e2>USPS</e2>, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and Swiss Post.
The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called <e1>APT-C-23</e1> targeting individuals in the <e2>Middle East</e2>. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook.
On iOS devices, <e1>DualToy</e1> installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a <e2>fake iOS App Store</e2> is not unique.

Researchers note that XLoader has been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called the <e2>Yanbian Gang</e2>. XLoader is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps. The malicious apps collect device owners’ personal information and financial information. XLoader distributed via DNS domains XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps. These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices. Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges. After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. XLoader linked to <e1>Yanbian</e1> hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang.

At the same time, the <e1>Cerberus</e1> team was making announcements about a soon-to-be-published second version of the Trojan in their commercial topic in an underground forum. Therefore, we initially assumed that the samples discovered are in fact the first/test versions of that advertised new version of the Trojan and classified them as such. That held until 5 days later. Enter the ring On January 18th, we discovered an interesting new post from another actor in an underground forum. This actor, whose name matches the newly introduced module name for the malware in question, started to advertise his own private malware with VNC feature. For the sake of clarity: Although VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a specific graphical desktop-sharing system, threat actors often label all Trojans with remote access capabilities (RAT) as embedding VNC, regardless of the technology being used. This discovery also matched the fact that the newly found samples included the RAT feature, making use of <e2>TeamViewer</e2> to provide remote access to the infected device.
Despite <e1>Ginp</e1>’s expansion to Turkey, we assess the group will continue to target Spanish banking customers, as well, based on recent overlay screens our team found on the malware’s C&C server aimed at <e2>Spanish banks</e2>. The malware no longer appears to target Poland or the UK, but that targeting strategy may change at any time.
If the recipient clicks on the links in these messages, malicious code is downloaded onto the Android device that installs the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware. The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday. FakeSpy has been active in the wild since at least 2017. Its operators have been refining the information stealer’s code over the last three years and adding capabilities, according to Cybereason.

It’s interesting that <e2>Triout</e2>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from Israel. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample. A subsequent investigation revealed that the spyware has the following capabilities: Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php) Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php) Has capability to hide self Can send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.php) Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C (uppc.php, fi npic.php orreqpic.php) Can send GPS coordinates to C&C <e1>(gps3.php)</e1> The C&C server to which the application seems to be sending collected data appears to be operational, as of this writing, and running since May 2018.
The well-developed <e1>Mandrake</e1> spyware has been continuously updated with new features, bug patches, and improved functionalities over a period of four years. The threat actors involved are using the spyware to take on individual targets. In this campaign, the spyware is used to first do a complete scan of the device and capture personal information about the targeted victim. After this, the attackers gain access to the users' preferences, device usage, inactivity times, and have the ability to record their screens. What are its capabilities? Using the spyware, the attackers could do anything from credential stealing and information exfiltration, to money transfers and blackmailing. It can also be used to surreptitiously turn the volume of the phone down and block calls or messages. The researchers noted that the attackers might also be running an affiliate program to sell the victims' information or access to others. Who is targeted? The first attack wave from the threat actors was observed in 2016-2017 which was directed at targets in the UK, <e2>US</e2>, Germany, and the Netherlands.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts.

<e1>Skygofree</e1>: Powerful <e2>Android</e2> spyware with advanced surveillance tools Android spyware has advanced surveillance capabilities, including turning on the mic when the victim enters specific geolocations.
Dubbed <e1>Skygofree</e1>, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.” Surveillance capabilities Although the Android malware has numerous creepy spying capabilities, 48 different commands in the latest implant, Kaspersky described the “geofence” command as one of the most notable features. A location can be specified so that when the victim’s device matches that location, “the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.” The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured. Kaspersky gives examples of how it steals Facebook data, Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, Viber and <e2>LINE</e2> for free calls and messages.

As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, Germany, <e2>United States of America</e2>, Italy, France, Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
<e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> Now Disguised As <e2>Netflix</e2> App A new version of the SpyNote Trojan is designed to trick Android users into thinking it’s a legitimate Netflix application.
So far, <e1>DualToy</e1> mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, <e2>United Kingdom</e2>, Thailand, Spain and Ireland.
After gaining root privilege, <e2>SpyDealer</e2> takes steps to maintain persistence on the compromised device. It first drops a native executable file powermanager to its own data directory (Figure 6.) Once executed, powermanager creates a backup the app’s APK file to /system/bin/update_1.apk. Whenever the app is uninstalled (Figure 7,) the running powermanager will copy the APK file from <e1>/system/bin/update_1.apk</e1> to /system/app/Update.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, <e2>NetEase Mail</e2>, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
In the past, <e2>XLoader</e2> showed the ability to mine cryptocurrency on PCs and perform account phishing on iOS devices. This new wave also presents unique attack vectors based on the kind of device it has accessed. In the case of Android devices, accessing the malicious website or pressing any of the buttons will prompt the download of the APK. However, successfully installing this malicious APK requires that the user has allowed the installation of such apps as controlled in the Unknown Sources settings. If users allow such apps to be installed, then it can be actively installed on the victim’s device. The infection chain is slightly more roundabout in the case of Apple devices. Accessing the same malicious site would redirect its user to another malicious website <e1>(hxxp://apple-icloud[.]qwq-japan[.]com</e1> or hxxp://apple-icloud[.
Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, <e2>lawyers</e2>, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes.
Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. <e1>Monokle</e1> supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, <e2>Skype</e2>, and Snapchat.
Similarly to another Android spyware made in <e2>Italy</e2>, originally discovered by Lukas Stefanko and later named <e1>Skygofree</e1> and analyzed in depth by Kaspersky Labs, Exodus also takes advantage of "protectedapps", a feature in Huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web <e2>AhnLab</e2> Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable.
Moreover, <e1>XLoader</e1> and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and <e2>South Korea</e2>. XLoader version 6.
What’s going on? <e1>Ginp</e1> malware was first discovered in 2019 and started as an SMS stealer. However, it soon upgraded itself to being one of the most advanced financial fraud landscape actors. Its target set consists mostly of customers of Spanish banks; nevertheless, the operators are planning on evolving their strategies to propagate in Turkey. Know the history The initial version of the malware masqueraded as a Google Play Verificator app. In August 2019, a new variant was launched with banking-specific capabilities, disguised as fake Adobe Flash Player apps. The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with <e2>Viber</e2> and Snapchat.
In conclusion, what’s next Considering the growing demand for <e2>Android</e2> banking malware, we can definitely expect actors to continue using <e1>Anubis</e1>. Although the creator has vanished the threat is still real; the malware will continue to operate and provide its advanced features to ill-intentioned actors.
New <e1>TangleBot</e1> malware is targeting Android devices in the US and Canada A cyber security company, Proofpoint/Cloudmark has recently identified a new threat that can take over the victim’s mobile phone through SMS. The threat has been found in the United States and in <e2>Canada</e2> and as per the reports, Android users are the main target of this malware.
As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, Germany, United States of America, Italy, France, Poland, Australia and the <e2>United Kingdom</e2>. Conclusion Once again, 2020 shows interesting changes to the mobile threat landscape.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo. Chunghwa Post - The government-owned corporation <e2>Chunghwa</e2> is the official postal service of Taiwan.
<e1>SpyNote</e1> Trojan (RAT); Yet Another Bad News for Android Users <e2>SpyNote RAT</e2> was found leaked on a dark net forum — The researchers have warned about downloading Android apps from a third-party site to avoid this RAT infecting your device.
Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. <e1>Monokle</e1> supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data.

Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, <e2>Whatsapp</e2>, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Snapchat.
Permission <e1>Alien</e1> uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the <e2>Accessibility privileges</e2> on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself.
A never-before-publicized mobile spy tool, a mobile surveillanceware remote access trojan (RAT) for <e2>Android</e2> called <e1>Monokle</e1>, has been spotted using novel techniques to exfiltrate data.
FakeSpy Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the <e2>Roaming Mantis</e2> threat group infect Android users with the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

The use of a specific certificate and SSL verification means that the malware will not talk to just any listening HTTPS server, which adds complexity to analyzing <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> in a sandbox environment. To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to "trick" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified. Functionality & Targeted Applications As described in the Project Zero and CitizenLab posts, the malware contains a list of applications for which it will steal data automatically if they are installed. Since the last analysis, the following applications have been added to this list: Signal (org.whispersystems.signal) ProtonMail (ch.protonmail.protonmail) The inclusion of these apps suggests they are being more commonly used by the Uyghur community than before. In particular, the inclusion of Signal and ProtonMail may suggest that the Uyghurs are aware of potential monitoring of their communications and are attempting to use applications with strong security features to avoid this. It is also worth noting that this implant also targets the popular messaging app WeChat. This app is referenced as "com.tencent.xin" in other write-ups, but it is not mentioned as <e2>WeChat</e2>. Volexity also noted that the malware has no mechanism for persistence.
What we found were several other fake apps developed using the <e1>SpyNote</e1> builder, which should come as a warning to Android users. Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update <e2>Instagram</e2> Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV Hotstar Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come.
It’s interesting that we can recover its original file name which is fb_mem_root. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 also gain root privilege thought another method that doesn’t use “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drop files including sux, getroot, logo.png and <e1>busybox_g1</e1> from assets to the app’s own data directory.
The malware, known as <e1>Pegasus</e1> (or Trident), was created by Israeli cyber-security firm <e2>NSO Group</e2> and has been around for at least three years --when it was first detailed in a report over the summer of 2016.
In a recent malware operation, the <e1>Anubis</e1> Android banking malware is targeting clients of approximately 400 banking institutions. The cybercriminals are attacking financial institutions, <e2>cryptocurrency wallets</e2>, and digital payment systems by posing as an Orange S.
and Europe or the <e1>CovidLock</e1> <e2>Android</e2> ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients.
Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average <e1>Anubis</e1> sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, <e2>North-America</e2> and Australia.
]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

Coronavirus Update App Leads to <e1>Project Spy</e1> Android and <e2>iOS</e2> Spyware We discovered a potential cyberespionage campaign, which we have named Project Spy, that infects Android and iOS devices with spyware (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_ProjectSpy.
The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called <e2>Dardesh</e2> via links to Google Play.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: <e1>ru.row.glass</e1> Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.
Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that <e1>Ginp</e1> malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of Turkish banks, after targeting <e2>Spanish</e2> banking customers and customers in Poland and the United Kingdom.
” On the self-signing front, with root access, <e1>Monokle</e1> is capable of installing additional attacker-specified certificates to the trusted certificates on an infected device, “effectively opening up the target and the device to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against TLS traffic,” the researchers wrote. To do this, it remounts system partition to install attacker specified certificate in /system/etc/security/cacerts/). Other functionality includes a cornucopia of classic spyware tricks, such as the ability to harvest contacts and calendar information, record audio and calls, retrieve emails and messages (including from <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Skype and more), take photos and videos, track device location and take screenshots.
Unique <e1>Monokle</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Spyware Self-Signs Certificates Researchers have linked the surveillance tool to a Russian tech firm that has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.
One of the new <e2>HummingWhale</e2> apps came to the attention of Check Point after it noticed a familiar piece of code that appeared in not one, but a dozen different apps, which indicated that malware was installed within them. Can install infinite number of malware apps All of the apps found were uploaded using the names of fake Chinese developers. In addition to these apps, 16 distinct package names related to the same malware were found on the Google Play Store. The most alarming element of the app was a 1.3MB file called <e1>‘assets/group.png’,</e1> a suspiciously large file that matched many of the traits seen in HummingBad, indicating the link between HummingWhale and its predecessor.
Exodus: New Android Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named <e1>Exodus</e1>, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two. We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victims are located in Italy. All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google. We believe this spyware platform is developed by an Italian company called eSurv, which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance. According to public records it appears that <e2>eSurv</e2> began to also develop intrusion software in 2016.
We labeled this new variant <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0, because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in Instagram and <e2>Tumblr</e2> profiles.
Here are some of the features of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and <e2>Gmail</e2> messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger.
New malware seizes on COVID-19 to target Android users A new form of malware that experts are referring to as "<e1>TangleBot</e1>" is relying on interest in COVID-19 to trick Android users in the U.S and <e2>Canada</e2> into clicking on a link that will infect their cell phones, according to analysts at the mobile and email security company Cloudmark.
What we found were several other fake apps developed using the <e1>SpyNote</e1> builder, which should come as a warning to Android users. Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader <e2>Google Update</e2> Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV Hotstar Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come.

Geography of Rotexy attacks According to our data, 98% of all <e2>Rotexy</e2> attacks target users in Russia. Indeed, the Trojan explicitly targets Russian-speaking users. There have also been cases of users in Ukraine, Germany, Turkey and several other countries being affected. Kaspersky Internet Security for Android and the Sberbank Online app securely protect users against attacks by this Trojan.

Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used <e2>Pegasus</e2> to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes.
Our analysis shows that the threat actor behind the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware is a Chinese-speaking group, commonly referred to as "<e2>Roaming Mantis</e2>", a group that is known to have launched similar campaigns in the past.
Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw <e1>XLoader</e1> malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major <e2>Japanese home delivery service</e2> company in June 2018.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module “ip” This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off “VerifyApps” and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the “initial phase”, the Trojan will install the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app. Its main purpose is to download archives and execute the “start” binary from them. During the investigation, this app was able to successfully connect to the command and control server, but it received no commands. So I don’t know what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files. Conclusions This Trojan was distributed through the Google Play Store and uses a number of very dangerous techniques, including patching system libraries. It installs malicious modules with different functionality into the system. It looks like its main purpose is to get into the system and execute downloaded files with root rights. But I never received such files from their command and control server. These malicious modules report to the attackers about every step they are going to make. So I think that the authors are still testing this malware, because they use some techniques which can break the infected devices. But they already have a lot of infected users on whom to test their methods. I hope that by uncovering this malware at such an early stage, we will be able to prevent a massive and dangerous attack when the attackers are ready to actively use their methods.

For example, the Ztorg Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play almost 100 times since September 2016. But <e2>Dvmap</e2> is very special rooting malware. It uses a variety of new techniques, but the most interesting thing is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries – libdmv.so or <e1>libandroid_runtime.so</e1>. This makes Dvmap the first Android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime, and it has been downloaded from the Google Play Store more than 50,000 times.
One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target <e2>Mansoor</e2>, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, <e2>Hangouts</e2>, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps. The spyware can now record victims’ screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype and <e2>Messenger</e2>. The malware also leverages a tactic where it creates a blank screen overlay to put on the Android screen while it makes calls, which helps it hide its call activity.
The disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission’s New Media and Information Security Department by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT). <e1>TangleBot</e1> <e2>Android</e2> malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur.

This newest variant has been labeled <e1>XLoader</e1> version 6.0 (detected as AndroidOS_XLoader.HRXD), following the last version discussed in a previous research on the malware family. Infection chain The threat actors behind this version used several fake websites as their host — copying that of a <e2>Japanese mobile phone operator’s website</e2> in particular — to trick users into downloading the fake security Android application package (APK).
This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user’s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols. Push notifications were also used to control audio recording. Lookout has shared information about this family with Apple, and they have revoked the affected certificates. As a result, no new instances of this app can be installed on iOS devices and existing installations can no longer be run. Lookout customers are also protected from this threat on both <e2>Android</e2> and iOS.
The newly uncovered banking <e1>Alien</e1> trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials! When it has infected a device, the RAT tries to take passwords from at least 226 mobile applications; including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking & Capital One Mobile, as well as many collaboration & social apps e.g. Snapchat, <e2>Telegram</e2> & Microsoft Outlook.
Dubbed <e1>Skygofree</e1>, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.” Surveillance capabilities Although the Android malware has numerous creepy spying capabilities, 48 different commands in the latest implant, Kaspersky described the “geofence” command as one of the most notable features. A location can be specified so that when the victim’s device matches that location, “the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.” The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured. Kaspersky gives examples of how it steals Facebook data, <e2>Facebook messenger</e2>, WhatsApp, Viber and LINE for free calls and messages.
This local port is used by <e2>Exodus</e2> Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases. However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone. The rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to TCP port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands. Sending the command sh to TCP <e1>port 6200</e1> results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise Exodus One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b Exodus One Package Names com.
XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and <e1>FakeSpy</e1> have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called <e2>Yanbian Gang</e2>.

STEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION <e1>FakeSpy</e1> has multiple built in information stealing capabilities. The first function is used for contact information stealing: the function upCon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information. Then, it sends it to the C2 server using the URL that ends with /servlet/ContactUpload. The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number and contact’s phone number Contacts - A headline used for the attacker to distinguish between the type of stolen information he gets Name - Contact’s full name (Display name) For testing purposes we inserted a fake contacts list to our <e2>Android</e2> Emulator and observed resultant behavior.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Smishing: The Major Way To Distribute RuMMS We have not observed any instances of <e2>RuMMS</e2> on Google Play or other online app stores. Smishing (SMS phishing) is currently the primary way threat actors are distributing the malware. The process starts when an SMS phishing message arrives at a user’s phone. An example SMS message is shown in Figure 1. The message translates roughly to“ You got a photo in MMS format: <e1>hxxp://yyyyyyyy.XXXX.ru/mms.apk.</e1>” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread RuMMS in the wild.
Dubbed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> (Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, <e2>Viber</e2>, and updates for both Android and Flash Player.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: <e2>WeChat</e2>, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
Later the malware using local SQLite database, to store the data that harvested from infected mobile and an information about C&C servers. “<e2>Rotexy</e2> intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C. Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers. This trojan force users to enter only right credentials and it checks all the details against the data that it already received. Once the victim entered all the data then it checks the originality of the data and uploaded into C&C server.

This is not the first time that malware is being spread via third party app stores, as seen in last year’s <e1>Fobus</e1> attack involving <e2>Super Mario Run</e2>. Users are advised to avoid third party-app stores, as the lack of security regulations could expose them to malware.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: google.servlce.store gooogle.services goooogle.services play.google.servlce.store play.gooogle.services <e1>play.goooogle.services.</e1> These malicious domains have been flagged on VirusTotal for a few months, with more reports accumulating over time.
The Flash zero-day exploit (<e2>CVE-2015-5119</e2>) was added into the <e1>Angler Exploit Kit</e1> and Nuclear Exploit Pack.
Dubbed ViceLeaker; researchers claim that it is the product of a group of hackers that is specifically targeting Middle Eastern and Israeli citizens. <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> campaign utilizes the notorious surveillance malware called Triout, and Kaspersky researchers detected it for the first time in May 2018. It is worth noting that Bitdefender also reported about the campaign in one of their recent blog posts, therefore, Kaspersky isn’t the only firm to have detected the malware campaign. Initial analysis revealed that hackers were targeting “dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens.” The spyware sensors used by Kaspersky detected attack signals from the device belonging to one of the victims along with the hash of an <e2>Android</e2> application (APK) involved in the attack.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on <e2>French</e2> users of Orange S.
According to Wandera, the criminals had targeted victims working at several“Big Four” consultancy firms. “<e1>RedDrop</e1> is one of the most sophisticated pieces of <e2>Android</e2> malware that we have seen in broad distribution,” said Wandera in an overview of its research published Wednesday.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages 3 reqcalllog.php Upload specified file from the device to the C2 4 reqcalllog.php Download file from specified URL and save on device 5 reqcalllog.php Delete specified file 6,7,8 reqcalllog.php Commands not yet implemented 9 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with rear camera, send to C2 10 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with front camera, send to C2 All observed samples with Smali injections were signed by the same debug certificate (<e1>0x936eacbe07f201df</e1>).

Static Analysis of <e2>Cerberus</e2> A quick look at the original manifest This sophisticated trojan has a large AndroidManifest file: lots of receivers, activities, services, intent-filters etc. The code found in the distributed APK is the same in the majority of classes”. The code is heavily obfuscated and has no real purpose other than to waste the analyst’s time. Besides the heavily obfuscated package name, two activities that caught our attention were: Why would such an app want to send and receive text messages, record audio, and read the user’s contact list? And the fact that, the path to the class names is not found (the root element qugyujzldpxqazyrqtc is not present on the left side, under “Source code”). Analyzing the payload The payload of this variant is a dex file named RRoj.json. When the payload is decompiled, it shows the obfuscated code of the malware. This reveals the class names which have been referenced in the distributed APK manifest file <e1>(qugyujzldpxqazyrqtc.uindwdxr.smlelfodpiernkx</e1> ).

Later the malware using local SQLite database, to store the data that harvested from infected mobile and an information about C&C servers. “<e2>Rotexy</e2> intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C. Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers. This trojan force users to enter only right credentials and it checks all the details against the data that it already received. Once the victim entered all the data then it checks the originality of the data and uploaded into C&C server.

]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

It’s interesting that <e2>Triout</e2>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from Israel. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample.

Exodus: New Android Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named <e1>Exodus</e1>, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two. We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victims are located in Italy. All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google. We believe this spyware platform is developed by an Italian company called <e2>eSurv</e2>, which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance.

Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, <e2>Viber</e2>, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.
Since <e2>TrickMo</e2>’s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the “4” key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You’re Infected? The following SMS message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key: HrLbpr3x/htAVnAgYepBuH2xmFDb68TYTt7FwGn0ddGlQJv/hqsctL57ocFU0Oz3L+uhLcOGG7GVBAfHKL1TBQ== Sending this SMS will trigger TrickMo’s kill switch by sending the string “4” encrypted with the generated RSA public key and base64 encoded.

KISMET Citizen Lab’s analysis of the attacks, released Sunday, found that the attackers found a footing on the phones from which to install <e1>Pegasus</e1> by exploiting a zero-day in Apple’s iMessage feature for iPhone. “The phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call <e2>KISMET</e2>, which appears to involve an invisible zero-click exploit in iMessage,” researchers said in the Sunday posting.
The full capabilities of <e1>Mandrake</e1> – which has been observed targeting users across Europe and the <e2>Americas</e2> – are detailed in a paper by cybersecurity researchers at Bitdefender.
For example, the Ztorg Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play almost 100 times since September 2016. But <e2>Dvmap</e2> is very special rooting malware. It uses a variety of new techniques, but the most interesting thing is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries – <e1>libdmv.so</e1> or libandroid_runtime.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust, and <e2>Wells Fargo</e2>. Who Is Responsible?
a Android hacking tool they have ever seen. <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> is a sophisticated, real-world surveillance and hacking tool that provides even unskilled hackers to deploy one of the world's more advanced surveillance suites for Google's mobile operating system <e2>Android</e2>. List of Creepy Features of Android Hacking Tool Once installed on targets' devices, RCSAndroid would have helped government and law enforcement agencies around the world to completely compromise and monitor Android devices remotely.
Dubbed <e1>Skygofree</e1>, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.” Surveillance capabilities Although the Android malware has numerous creepy spying capabilities, 48 different commands in the latest implant, Kaspersky described the “geofence” command as one of the most notable features. A location can be specified so that when the victim’s device matches that location, “the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.” The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured. Kaspersky gives examples of how it steals Facebook data, Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, Viber and LINE for free calls and messages. The payload targeting <e2>WhatsApp</e2> messenger uses the Android Accessibility Service to grab WhatsApp text messages.
Here are some of the features of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and <e2>LinkedIn</e2> Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger.
The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> streamlines this process. By keylogging the user’s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user’s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible. These features are staples of PC banking malware and are evolving in Android malware as well. The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address <e2>Turkish</e2> users.
<e1>ViceLeaker</e1> <e2>Android</e2> malware steals call recordings, photos, videos & texts Israeli Citizens are the Primary Target of New Android Mobile Spying Campaign Using ViceLeaker Malware, says Kaspersky.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the <e2>United States</e2> federal government.
Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e2>DualToy</e2> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: <e1>f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84</e1>).
The campaign seeks to deliver Anubis, a particularly nasty piece of malware that was originally used for cyber espionage and retooled as a banking trojan. <e1>Anubis</e1> can completely hijack an Android mobile device, steal data, record phone calls, and even hold the device to ransom by encrypting the victim’s personal files. With mobile devices increasingly used in the corporate environment, thanks to the popularity of BYOD policies, this malware has the potential to cause serious harm, mostly to consumers, and businesses that allow the installation of unsigned applications. Here’s how it works: At first glance, the email shown in Figure 1 looks like any other phishing email that asks the user to download an invoice. However, this particular email downloads an Android Package Kit (APK), which is the common format used by Android to distribute and install applications. Let’s take a closer look at the suspicious file. When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file (Fattura002873.apk), is downloaded. Upon opening the file, the user is asked to enable “Google Play Protect” as shown in Figure 2. However, this is not a genuine “Google Play Protect” screen; instead it gives the app all the permissions it needs while simultaneously disabling the actual Google Play Protect. A closer look at the code reveals the application gathers a list of installed applications to compare the results against a list of targeted applications (Figure 4). The malware mainly targets <e2>banking and financial applications</e2>, but also looks for popular shopping apps such as eBay or Amazon.

Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module “ip” This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off “VerifyApps” and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the “initial phase”, the Trojan will install the <e1>“com.qualcmm.timeservices”</e1> app.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - <e2>Deutsche Post DHL Group</e2>, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn.
New versions of <e1>FakeSpy</e1> masquerade as government <e2>post office apps</e2> and transportation services apps.
Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique <e1>CometBot</e1> (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting <e2>German banks</e2> at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

Customers of <e2>Chase</e2>, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Capital One, along with nearly 400 other financial institutions, are being targeted by a malicious app disguised to look like the official account management platform for French telecom company Orange S.
A malicious Android app has been uncovered on the Google Play app marketplace that is distributing the banking trojan, <e1>Cerberus</e1>. The app has 10,000 downloads. Researchers said that the trojan was found within the last few days, as it was being spread via a Spanish currency converter app (called “Calculadora de Moneda”), which has been available to <e2>Android</e2> users in Spain since March.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices.

Cerberus Android Malware Gains Ability to Steal 2FA Tokens, Screen Lock Credentials The <e1>Cerberus</e1> <e2>Android</e2> malware family has gained the ability to steal its victims’ two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens and screen lock credentials.
That APK downloads an app that appears to be from the local region’s legitimate postal service—such as the United States Postal Service (USPS)–but actually executes <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, an infostealer that requests permissions to take over SMS messages and steal sensitive data on devices. The malware, which has been a threat since 2017, also can access and use a target device’s contact list to infect other devices. Researchers believe that Chinese-speaking group known as “<e2>Roaming Mantis</e2>” is behind the campaign.
According to Wandera, the criminals had targeted victims working at several“Big Four” consultancy firms. “<e2>RedDrop</e2> is one of the most sophisticated pieces of Android malware that we have seen in broad distribution,” said Wandera in an overview of its research published Wednesday. “Not only does the attacker utilize a wide range of functioning malicious applications to entice the victim, they’ve also perfected every tiny detail to ensure their actions are difficult to trace.” Wandera told Threatpost it’s unsure how many Android devices may be infected with the malware. “One thing we have noticed is that the pace of attempted infections appears to be accelerating,” Wandera said. Since the company initially identified the malware, the company has blocked roughly 20 further requests by infected apps to reach the criminal’s distribution network – where additional malware would be downloaded from. The apps are being promoted via ads displayed on the popular Chinese search engine Baidu. Researchers said those who click on the ads are “taken to <e1>huxiawang[.]cn,</e1> the primary distribution site for the attack.

Called “<e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1>”, the banking trojan was available on Google Play at the time of the analysis. The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however, this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable Android’s Accessibility Service – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality. The DEFENSOR ID app made it onto the heavily guarded Google Play store thanks to its extreme stealth. Its creators reduced the app’s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious functionalities but one: abusing Accessibility Service. Accessibility Service is long known to be the Achilles’ heel of the <e2>Android</e2> operating system.
apk to view the message” Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, <e1>MazarBOT</e1> downloads a copy of Tor onto users’ Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim’s location to an Iranian mobile phone number. With the malware now in place, a number of actions can be performed, including allowing attackers to secretly monitor and control smartphones via a backdoor, send messages to premium-rate numbers, and intercept two-factor authentication codes sent by online banking apps and the like. In fact, with full access to the compromised <e2>Android</e2> smartphone, the opportunities for criminals to wreak havoc are significant – such as erasing infected phones or launching man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of <e1>Android/Twitoor.A,</e1> can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or <e2>MMS application</e2> but without having their functionality.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro <e2>Dr. Web</e2> AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable.
OmniRat was detected in 2015 targeting MAC, Windows or Andriod operating system while <e1>DroidJack</e1> RAT was found also found in fake Pokémon Go apps on <e2>Android</e2> store.
Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the <e2>United States</e2>. The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the Android recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing.

SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, <e2>Line</e2>, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust and <e2>Wells Fargo</e2>,” Balaam said.
Abusing Android's Accessibility Features to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the CERT-Bund last September, the <e1>TrickMo</e1> campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their <e2>Android</e2> devices.

Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e2>DualToy</e2> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the <e1>insapp.dll</e1> will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer.
Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as <e1>Ghost Push</e1> that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year.

Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps. The spyware can now record victims’ screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, <e2>Facebook</e2>, Skype and Messenger.

Once fully installed, <e1>Exodus</e1> was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from <e2>WeChat</e2> app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.
In this case we found traces of <e1>dx/dexmerge compilers</e1>, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.
Besides the commands listed above, <e2>SpyDealer</e2> can also set the remote server’s IP address under the following two conditions: The length of the command index received in the SMS (Table 3) is larger than 4, then the command index is actually the remote server’s IP address The incoming SMS message body starts with the string “<e1>L112</e1> ” which is followed by the remote server’s IP address If SpyDealer receives a command index of 1 or 2, it will not reply when it received an SMS command.

All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive <e1>(Game324.res</e1> or Game644.

The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, <e2>Viber</e2>, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.

Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

The code of <e1>Gino</e1> has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called <e2>Anubis</e2>. Researchers further claim that there are striking similarities between the codes of both Trojans but it cannot be said that Ginp is the replica of Anubis rather it is inspired by Anubis.

In its analysis, CSIS notes that <e1>MazarBOT</e1> was reported by Recorded Future last November as being actively sold in <e2>Russian</e2> underground forums and intriguingly, the malware will not activate on Android devices configured with Russian language settings.
An in-depth analysis of <e1>SpyNote</e1> remote access trojan Find out what a remote access trojan (RAT) is and see how it can affect its victims' devices. Lookout researchers have recently discovered a surveillance campaign targeting Syrian citizens and it is believed that the actor behind the attack was state-sponsored. The campaign had been active since January 2018 and its goal was to infect Android mobile devices with remote access trojans (RATs) and then spy on people in possession of those devices. The victims were tricked into downloading and installing innocent-looking mobile applications which were actually spyware. The applications were shared through various communication channels; however, they were never available on the official Google Play Store. Some applications attempted to masquerade as legitimate ones like Telegram, others were COVID-19 contact tracing apps or benign tools like a <e2>fake digital thermometer</e2>, and others impersonated Android built-in tools.

This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 campuphome[.]com 9 8 <e1>wewelowertick[.]com</e1> 3 9 bigslogous[.

In this blog, we showed that the threat actor behind the recent <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaign is a Chinese-speaking group called “Roaming Mantis” known to operate mainly in <e2>Asia</e2>. It is interesting to see that the group has expanded their operation to other regions, such as the United States and Europe.
Then in the next version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> trojan malware in 2015-2016, it starts using the AES algorithm to encrypt the data between the user’s device and C&C server. In 2017-2018 HTML phishing pages bank.html, update.html ad <e1>extortionist.html</e1> starts appearing in the assets folder.
According to researchers, <e1>Cerberus</e1> already contains overlay attack templates for a total of 30 unique targets, including: 7 French banking apps 7 U.S. banking apps 1 <e2>Japanese banking</e2> app 15 non-banking apps Cerberus Uses Motion-based Evasion Tactic Cerberus also uses some interesting techniques to evade detection from antivirus solutions and prevent its analysis, like using the device accelerometer sensor to measure movements of the victim.
The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, <e1>Anubis</e1> itself is based on the <e2>Bankbot</e2> Trojan, which was made public on purpose.

Similar to previous malware which infiltrated <e2>Google Play</e2>, such as FalseGuide and <e1>Skinner</e1>, Judy relies on the communication with its Command and Control server (C&C) for its operation.
” One example of a message used in the latest <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaign is an alert from the postal service local to the region of the victim, informing them that the service tried to send a package, but the receiver was not at home, for instance. Then, “the link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK),” according to a report on the campaign, by Ofir Almkias, mobile analyst with Cybereason. That APK downloads an app that appears to be from the local region’s legitimate postal service—such as the <e2>United States Postal Service (USPS)</e2>–but actually executes FakeSpy, an infostealer that requests permissions to take over SMS messages and steal sensitive data on devices.
<e1>RuMMS</e1> malware is back…with enhancements Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team came across a nasty piece of malware hosted on a fake MMS website called mmsprivate[.]site. The site lures victims with what seem to be private photos, inviting them to take a closer look. Upon accepting the offer, victims fall prey to a malicious <e2>Android</e2> Package (APK) that downloads onto their phones.
<e1>Mandrake</e1> spyware hoovers up information raging from account credentials, screen records, GPS and more -- and has been for years. All while those behind it carefully cover their tracks. A carefully managed hacking and espionage campaign is infecting smartphones with a potent form of <e2>Android</e2> malware, providing those behind it with total control of the device, while also remaining completely hidden from the user.
The modern version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware. It spreads under the name AvitoPay.apk (or similar) and downloads from websites with names like youla9d6h.tk, <e1>prodam8n9.tk,</e1> prodamfkz.
For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “/[number]” (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. In this version of Rotexy, dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used. 2016 From mid-2016 on, the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains. No other significant changes were observed in the Trojan’s network behavior. In late 2016, versions of the Trojan emerged that contained the card.html phishing page in the assets/www folder. The page was designed to steal users’ bank card details: 2017–2018 From early 2017, the HTML phishing pages <e1>bank.html,</e1> update.

XLoader: A deep insight into the Android malware’s various campaigns <e1>XLoader</e1> was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate <e2>Facebook</e2> or Chrome apps.
The most recent warning of <e2>Android</e2> malware relates to a new banking trojan called <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> that has managed to infiltrate a number of third-party app stores using a variety of disguises including bogus WhatsApp and Viber apps as well as malicious Flash Player updates.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

For the purpose of this report we analyze here the <e2>Exodus</e2> One sample with hash 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 which communicated with the Command & Control server at <e1>54.71.249.137.</e1> Other samples communicated with other servers listed at the bottom of this report.
FakeSpy Android Malware Disguised as Postal Service Messages The operators behind an updated version of the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware are targeting <e2>Android</e2> devices using SMS phishing messages to spread the info stealer, according to the security firm Cybereason.
Dubbed <e1>ViceLeaker</e1>; researchers claim that it is the product of a group of hackers that is specifically targeting <e2>Middle Eastern</e2> and Israeli citizens.
It’s interesting that <e2>Triout</e2>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from Israel. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample. A subsequent investigation revealed that the spyware has the following capabilities: Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php) Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php) Has capability to hide self Can send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.php) Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C <e1>(uppc.php,</e1> fi npic.
<e1>Exodus</e1>: New Android Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new <e2>Android</e2> spyware platform we named Exodus, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two.
Stage 2: Exodus Two The Zip archive returned by the check-in performed by <e2>Exodus</e2> One is a collection of files including the primary payload <e1>mike.jar</e1> and several compiled utilities that serve different functions.
Coronavirus Update App Leads to Project Spy Android and iOS Spyware We discovered a potential cyberespionage campaign, which we have named <e1>Project Spy</e1>, that infects Android and <e2>iOS</e2> devices with spyware (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_ProjectSpy.
Google calls this threat <e2>Chrysaor</e2>, the brother of <e1>Pegasus</e1>. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android.
Kaspersky detects and blocks samples of the <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> operation using the following verdict: <e1>Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.ViceLeaker.*</e1> Actually, we are currently investigating whether this group might also be behind a large-scale web-oriented attack at the end of 2018 using code injection and exploiting SQL vulnerabilities.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and <e2>BlackBerry Messenger</e2>. Capture real-time voice calls in any network or app by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service RCSAndroid in the Wild Our analysis reveals that this RCSAndroid (AndroidOS_RCSAgent.

The spyware, called <e1>Pegasus</e1> and developed by the Israeli company <e2>NSO Group</e2>, is reportedly instrumental to several governments’ oppressive surveillance campaigns against their own citizens and residents, and, while NSO Group has repeatedly denied allegations that it complicitly sells Pegasus to human right abusers, it is difficult to reconcile exactly how the zero-click spyware program—which non-consensually and invisibly steals emails, text messages, photos, videos, locations, passwords, and social media activity—is at the same time a tool that can, in its very use, respect the rights of those around the world to speak freely, associate safely, and live privately.
These include: Controlling the phone’s keys Enabling the sleep mode Save actions in the phone’s settings, etc. <e1>Mazar BOT</e1> won’t run on Russian <e2>Android</e2> smartphones Our team was not surprised to observe that the malware cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with the Russian language option.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2> app.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab <e2>Avira</e2> Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable.

As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 <e1>hellowopung[.]com</e1> 102 5 quostpeopls[.
0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘<e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0’ that poses as a pornography app for <e2>Android</e2> devices.
According to public records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. <e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities. Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering. Disguised Spyware Uploaded on Google Play Store We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded. While details would vary, all of the identified copies of this spyware shared a similar disguise. In most cases they would be crafted to appear as applications distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Italy. Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page. All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian. According to Google, whom we have contacted to alert about our discoveries, nearly 25 variants of this spyware were uploaded on Google Play Store. Google Play has removed the apps and they stated that "thanks to enhanced detection models, Google Play Protect will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications". While Google did not share with us the total number of infected devices, they confirmed that one of these malicious apps collected over 350 installations through the Play Store, while other variants collected few dozens each, and that all infections were located in <e2>Italy</e2>. We have directly observed multiple copies of Exodus with more than 50 installs and we can estimate the total number of infections to amount in the several hundreds, if not a thousand or more.

After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on Google Play), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: <e1>RCS Android</e1> (Remote Control System Android). Unsurprisingly, it can do so many things and spy on so many levels that they consider it the most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The spyware is delivered either via the aforementioned app, or via an SMS or email that contain a specially crafted URL that will trigger exploits for several vulnerabilities in the default browsers of <e2>Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich</e2> to 4.
It evolved from an SMS based spyware that was active in 2014. <e2>Rotexy</e2> malware evaluation was at a peak in 2014 & 2015 and it mainly using the phishing links in order to compromise the users that prompt to install the malicious apps.

But <e1>Ginp</e1>’s authors did not stop there, repeatedly replenishing its arsenal with more inventive capabilities. For instance, the malware started using push notifications and pop-up messages to get the victim to open certain apps — those that it can overlay with phishing windows.

This malware has been dubbed “<e1>TangleBot</e1>.” The moniker refers to the obfuscation methods used to take control over entangled device functionalities. Distribution takes place via text message and targets Android owners in <e2>North America</e2>. In order to gain access to devices, the malware distributors used coronavirus and electricity-themed lures.
XLoader Disguises as Android Apps, Has FakeSpy Links In previous attacks, <e1>XLoader</e1> posed as <e2>Facebook</e2>, Chrome and other legitimate applications to trick users into downloading its malicious app.
Permission <e1>Alien</e1> uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself. It does this using an advanced remote access feature that compromises the TeamViewer application, giving the bad player behind the malware remote control over the victim’s devices. TeamViewer is a proprietary software application used for remote control, desktop & online meetings. Remote Control “When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access & change device settings, install & remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, <e2>messengers</e2> & social networks),” outlined researchers.
<e1>Skygofree</e1>: Following in the footsteps of HackingTeam At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new <e2>Android</e2> spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild.
Researchers discovered two apps, Currency Converter and BatterySaverMobo, used to spread <e1>Anubis</e1>. The threat actors also lure users into downloading the infected apps through phishing campaigns after stealing contact information from infected devices. Once the user downloads the <e2>Android</e2> banking trojan, the app monitors the device status to find the optimal time to execute attacks.
As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, <e2>Germany</e2>, United States of America, Italy, France, Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
This new <e1>XLoader</e1> variant poses as a security app for <e2>Android</e2> devices, and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.
RCSANDROID has the ability to: Collect Passwords for both networks (your WiFi) and accounts (your bank) Collect your location Record you calls or what is being said around your device Collect you contact information Collect you email and texts And a lot more. <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> was known about as far back as 2012. It uses two known vulnerabilities in the default Android Internet browser found in Android versions 4.0 to 4.3 (CVE-2012-2825 and CVE-2012-2871). There was also fake app on <e2>Google Play</e2> that helped compromise a system.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
tk, etc Rotexy mobile malware keeps requesting the mobile administrative privilege even users restart the mobile in safe mode even the malicious program will be removed. <e1>Rotexy</e1> mainly targeting Russian user’s, up to 98% of its infection in Russia and it also infecting users in Ukraine, Germany, <e2>Turkey</e2>, and several other countries.
The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the <e1>FrozenCell</e1> family attributed to <e2>APT-C-23</e2>. Also, the C&C infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families.
” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, <e1>mmsmtsh5</e1>, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.
After installation, the app begins its “real malicious activity” by downloading a set of dynamic libraries from the <e1>libmsy.so</e1> file, which executes the packed mycode.jar file to load various insidious information-stealing capabilities into <e2>FakeSpy</e2>’s process onto the device, Almkias said.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e2>Chrysaor</e2> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at <e1>/system/csk</e1> to elevate privileges.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module “ip” This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off “VerifyApps” and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the <e1>“com.qualcmm.timeservices”</e1> app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands.
Conclusion <e1>Gooligan</e1> has breached over a million <e2>Google</e2> accounts.
ThreatFabric analysts claim that <e1>Ginp</e1> is unique because its codebase was developed from scratch and is being expanded continuously through updates. Its target list is also considerably narrow as its main targets are the banks in <e2>Spain</e2>. The code of Gino has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis.
What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>iOS</e2>, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.
According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. "<e1>Gooligan</e1> potentially affects devices on Android 4 <e2>Jelly Bean</e2> and KitKat, and 5 Lollipop, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today.
However, the botnet operators can start distributing other malware, including ransomware, at any time warns Štefanko. “<e2>Twitoor</e2> serves as another example of how cybercriminals keep on innovating their business,” Stefanko continues. “The takeaway? Internet users should keep on securing their activities with good security solutions for both computers and mobile devices.” Hashes: E5212D4416486AF42E7ED1F58A526AEF77BE89BE <e1>A9891222232145581FE8D0D483EDB4B18836BCFC</e1> AFF9F39A6CA5D68C599B30012D79DA29E2672C6E
A TrickMo Kill Switch One of the most interesting features of the <e2>TrickMo</e2> malware is having its own kill switch. Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo’s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the “4” key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You’re Infected? The following SMS message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key: HrLbpr3x/htAVnAgYepBuH2xmFDb68TYTt7FwGn0ddGlQJv/hqsctL57ocFU0Oz3L+uhLcOGG7GVBAfHKL1TBQ== Sending this SMS will trigger TrickMo’s kill switch by sending the string “4” encrypted with the generated RSA public key and base64 encoded.

Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1>, to spy on targets in <e2>Palestine</e2>. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. Port 6209: Telegram extraction service. <e1>Port 6210</e1>: SBrowser extraction service.

The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called <e2>Connexxa S.R.L.</e2> Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa.

What’s going on? <e1>Ginp</e1> malware was first discovered in 2019 and started as an SMS stealer. However, it soon upgraded itself to being one of the most advanced financial fraud landscape actors. Its target set consists mostly of customers of Spanish banks; nevertheless, the operators are planning on evolving their strategies to propagate in Turkey. Know the history The initial version of the malware masqueraded as a Google Play Verificator app. In August 2019, a new variant was launched with banking-specific capabilities, disguised as fake Adobe Flash Player apps. The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with Viber and Snapchat. By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the Anubis trojan source code. Evolving capabilities With the operators’ plan to spread the trojan to Turkey, the following capabilities are worth a mention: Notifications blockers service RAT capabilities Injections locker How to stay safe? Download apps only from the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>. Do not click on suspicious links.
Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and <e2>Japanese</e2> speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Dubbed "<e1>Pegasus</e1>," the assault package leverages <e2>three zero-day vulnerabilities</e2> to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device.
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted South Korean and Japanese speakers. However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, <e2>Germany</e2>, United Kingdom, United States, and others.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland <e2>Russia</e2> Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
The Dardesh app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. “The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,” the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed <e2>APT-C-23</e2> to be behind this scheme.

Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms Instagram and <e2>Tumblr</e2> instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address. We labeled this new variant <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.
However, our research continues to demonstrate some highly concerning real-world examples of the abuse of <e2>NSO Group</e2> technology in practice. These uses have included apparent government customers of NSO Group abusing <e1>Pegasus</e1> spyware to target civil society groups, human rights defenders, lawyers, politicians, and journalists.
LESS-SOPHISTICATED <e1>EXODUS</e1> <e2>IOS</e2> VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit conference, the team at Lookout said it discovered an iOS variant of this spyware during their analysis of Exodus samples they've found last year.
And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. <e1>Cerberus</e1> was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing Anubis’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the <e2>banking apps</e2> inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: <e2>United States Postal Service</e2> - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government.
This new <e1>XLoader</e1> variant poses as a <e2>security app</e2> for Android devices, and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.
Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, <e1>Mandrake</e1> won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. For unknown reasons, it also avoids installing itself on phones with Verizon SIM cards, or SIM cards from a top Chinese cellular carrier. Its primary target appears to be Australia, followed by North America, western <e2>Europe</e2> (and Poland) and some of the richer parts of South America.
How to Defend Against Android Malware Security professionals can help defend their organizations against <e2>Android</e2> malware like <e1>XLoader</e1> by using a mobile threat prevention (MTP) platform to monitor devices for suspicious activity and automatically detect and remove malicious apps from infected devices.
However, the botnet operators can start distributing other malware, including ransomware, at any time warns Štefanko. “<e2>Twitoor</e2> serves as another example of how cybercriminals keep on innovating their business,” Stefanko continues. “The takeaway? Internet users should keep on securing their activities with good security solutions for both computers and mobile devices.” Hashes: E5212D4416486AF42E7ED1F58A526AEF77BE89BE A9891222232145581FE8D0D483EDB4B18836BCFC <e1>AFF9F39A6CA5D68C599B30012D79DA29E2672C6E</e1>
By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on <e2>Google Play</e2>. The developer name used, GAS Brazil, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users.
DroidJack: The Stalker's App Targeting Android Users An international cybercrime investigation is currently underway to target malicious users of spy software targeting Android users, known as <e1>DroidJack</e1>. Europol said that police from five European countries—Germany, France, the <e2>U.K.</e2>, Belgium and Switzerland—as well as U.
Last week, Fortinet researchers said <e2>BianLian</e2> -- which began life as a dropper for <e1>Anubis</e1> and is now an established banking Trojan on its own accord -- is now bypassing Google Android protections to propagate its malicious code.
Figure 7 lists the IP addresses of these C2 servers, the number of <e2>RuMMS</e2> apps that connect to each of them, and the example URL used as the first parameter of the HttpPost operation (used in the code of Figure 3). This indicates that multiple C2 servers were used in this campaign, but one <e1>(37.1.207.31)</e1> was the most heavily used.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. <e1>Port 6208</e1>: IMO extraction service.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including <e2>Skype</e2>, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.
One of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile Trojan from the <e1>Rotexy</e1> family. In a three-month period from August to October 2018, it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in <e2>Russia</e2>. An interesting feature of this family of banking Trojans is the simultaneous use of three command sources: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service – used to send small messages in JSON format to a mobile device via Google servers; malicious C&C server; incoming SMS messages.
The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, <e2>eBay</e2>, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Uber and more.

Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average <e1>Anubis</e1> sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the <e2>Americas</e2>: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

THREAT ANALYSIS Infection Vector: Smishing Your Device Thus far, <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a. smishing). These SMS messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the FakeSpy download. In a previous campaign reported by JPCERT, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. <e2>Targeting Postal</e2> and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world.
In its analysis, CSIS notes that <e1>MazarBOT</e1> was reported by Recorded Future last November as being actively sold in Russian underground forums and intriguingly, the malware will not activate on Android devices configured with Russian language settings. This, in itself, does not prove that the perpetrators of the malware campaign are based in <e2>Russia</e2>, but it certainly sounds as if that is a strong possibility.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, <e2>Taiwan</e2>, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on Google Play. The developer name used, GAS Brazil, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users. Apart from including the country’s name, the app’s name is probably intended to imply a relationship with the antifraud solution named GAS Tecnologia. That security software is commonly installed on computers in <e2>Brazil</e2> as several banks require it to log into their online banking.
The Growth of XLoader Trend Micro first observed efforts to distribute <e1>XLoader</e1> disguised as legitimate Facebook and Chrome apps in April 2018. Just months later, the security firm observed that the malware had infected 384,748 victims, with the bulk of affected users located in <e2>South Korea</e2> and Japan.
The campaign seeks to deliver Anubis, a particularly nasty piece of malware that was originally used for cyber espionage and retooled as a banking trojan. <e1>Anubis</e1> can completely hijack an Android mobile device, steal data, record phone calls, and even hold the device to ransom by encrypting the victim’s personal files. With mobile devices increasingly used in the corporate environment, thanks to the popularity of BYOD policies, this malware has the potential to cause serious harm, mostly to consumers, and businesses that allow the installation of unsigned applications. Here’s how it works: At first glance, the email shown in Figure 1 looks like any other phishing email that asks the user to download an invoice. However, this particular email downloads an Android Package Kit (APK), which is the common format used by Android to distribute and install applications. Let’s take a closer look at the suspicious file. When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file (Fattura002873.apk), is downloaded. Upon opening the file, the user is asked to enable “Google Play Protect” as shown in Figure 2. However, this is not a genuine “Google Play Protect” screen; instead it gives the app all the permissions it needs while simultaneously disabling the actual Google Play Protect. A closer look at the code reveals the application gathers a list of installed applications to compare the results against a list of targeted applications (Figure 4). The malware mainly targets banking and financial applications, but also looks for popular shopping apps such as eBay or <e2>Amazon</e2>. A full list of targeted applications is included in the IOC section at the end of this post.
<e1>SpyDealer</e1>: <e2>Android</e2> Trojan Spying on More Than 40 Apps With the prevalence of Google Android smartphones and the popularity of feature-rich apps, more and more people rely on smartphones to store and handle kinds of personal and business information which attracts adversaries who want to steal that information.
<e1>Skygofree</e1>: Following in the footsteps of HackingTeam At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. We observed many web landing pages that mimic the sites of mobile operators and which are used to spread the Android implants. These domains have been registered by the attackers since 2015. According to our telemetry, that was the year the distribution campaign was at its most active. The activities continue: the most recently observed domain was registered on October 31, 2017. Based on our KSN statistics, there are several infected individuals, exclusively in <e2>Italy</e2>. Moreover, as we dived deeper into the investigation, we discovered several spyware tools for Windows that form an implant for exfiltrating sensitive data on a targeted machine.
Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the U.S, U.K, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, <e2>India</e2> and Italy, according to researchers.
Cerberus: A New Android 'Banking Malware For Rent' Emerges August 13, 2019 After a few popular <e2>Android</e2> Trojans like Anubis, Red Alert 2.0, GM bot, and <e1>Exobot</e1>, quit their malware-as-a-service businesses, a new player has emerged on the Internet with similar capabilities to fill the gap, offering Android bot rental service to the masses.
In a recent malware operation, the <e1>Anubis</e1> Android banking malware is targeting clients of approximately 400 banking institutions. The cybercriminals are attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency wallets, and <e2>digital payment systems</e2> by posing as an Orange S.
Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Researchers have warned that over half of Android devices are still susceptible to <e1>Ghost Push</e1> malware.

All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from <e1>Game324.res</e1> or Game644.

What’s going on? <e1>Ginp</e1> malware was first discovered in 2019 and started as an SMS stealer. However, it soon upgraded itself to being one of the most advanced financial fraud landscape actors. Its target set consists mostly of customers of Spanish banks; nevertheless, the operators are planning on evolving their strategies to propagate in Turkey. Know the history The initial version of the malware masqueraded as a Google Play Verificator app. In August 2019, a new variant was launched with banking-specific capabilities, disguised as fake Adobe Flash Player apps. The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with Viber and Snapchat. By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the <e2>Anubis</e2> trojan source code.

The campaign seeks to deliver Anubis, a particularly nasty piece of malware that was originally used for cyber espionage and retooled as a banking trojan. <e2>Anubis</e2> can completely hijack an Android mobile device, steal data, record phone calls, and even hold the device to ransom by encrypting the victim’s personal files. With mobile devices increasingly used in the corporate environment, thanks to the popularity of BYOD policies, this malware has the potential to cause serious harm, mostly to consumers, and businesses that allow the installation of unsigned applications. Here’s how it works: At first glance, the email shown in Figure 1 looks like any other phishing email that asks the user to download an invoice. However, this particular email downloads an Android Package Kit (APK), which is the common format used by Android to distribute and install applications. Let’s take a closer look at the suspicious file. When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file <e1>(Fattura002873.apk),</e1> is downloaded.

However, the exploits used in this attack remains unknown to us as none of <e1>logo.png,</e1> getroot or busybox_g1 exists in the app’s assets.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices.

]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

Considering the other malicious behaviors of <e2>XLoader</e2>, this added operation could be very dangerous as threat actors can use it to perform targeted attacks. Malicious iOS profile In the case of Apple devices, the downloaded malicious iOS profile gathers the following: Unique device identifier (UDID) International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID) Mobile equipment identifier (MEID) Version number Product number The profile installations differ depending on the iOS. For versions 11.0 and 11.4, the installation is straightforward. If a user visits the profile host website and allows the installer to download, the iOS system will go directly to the “Install Profile” page (which shows a verified safety certificate), and then request the users’ passcode for the last step of installation. On later versions, specifically iOS 12.1.1 and iOS 12.2, the process is different. After the profile is downloaded, the iOS system will first ask users to review the profile in their settings if they want to install it. Users can see a “Profile Downloaded” added in their settings (this feature is in iOS 12.2, but not on iOS 12.1.1). This gives users a chance to see details and better understand any changes made. After the review, the process is the same as above. After the profile is installed, the user will then be redirected to another Apple phishing site. The phishing site uses the gathered information as its GET parameter, allowing the attacker to access the stolen information. Ongoing activity While monitoring this particular threat, we found another <e1>XLoader</e1> variant posing as a pornography app aimed at South Korean users.

Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, <e1>Mandrake</e1> won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions.

Its primary target appears to be Australia, followed by <e2>North America</e2>, western Europe (and Poland) and some of the richer parts of South America.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, <e2>Caixa Bank</e2>, EVO Banco, Santander, and Kutxabank.

The use of a specific certificate and SSL verification means that the malware will not talk to just any listening HTTPS server, which adds complexity to analyzing <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> in a sandbox environment. To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to "trick" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified. Functionality & Targeted Applications As described in the Project Zero and CitizenLab posts, the malware contains a list of applications for which it will steal data automatically if they are installed. Since the last analysis, the following applications have been added to this list: <e2>Signal</e2> (org.

If a visiting device passes the first checks put in place by Evil Eye, code similar to the following would be returned: The file jquery.js contains the main logic and the server's public key, while the file s.js contains the supporting Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library used to generate a client key pair. This client public key is passed as a variable into the loading of the final JavaScript. If each step of the JavaScript above is successful, it results in a Mach-O binary running on the phone. This application contains an iOS exploit for the targeted version and another Mach-O binary, the <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> implant, embedded in it.
Dubbed <e1>Skygofree</e1>, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.” Surveillance capabilities Although the Android malware has numerous creepy spying capabilities, 48 different commands in the latest implant, Kaspersky described the “geofence” command as one of the most notable features. A location can be specified so that when the victim’s device matches that location, “the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.” The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured. Kaspersky gives examples of how it steals Facebook data, Facebook messenger, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Viber and LINE for free calls and messages.

]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original <e1>/system/bin/ip</e1> with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.

This analysis dissects <e1>FakeSpy</e1>’s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions. DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOADING Once the application has finished the installation process, the malware starts its real malicious activity. The malicious application da.hao.pao.bin (<e2>Chunghwa Post</e2>) loads a library file libmsy.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.
DroidJack: The Stalker's App Targeting Android Users An international cybercrime investigation is currently underway to target malicious users of spy software targeting Android users, known as <e1>DroidJack</e1>. Europol said that police from five European countries—Germany, <e2>France</e2>, the U.
The team recently reported that downloader apps in the store are being used as the first step in an infection routine that fetches the <e1>Marcher</e1> (aka <e2>Marcher ExoBot</e2>) and BankBot Anubis mobile banking Trojans.
Finding new downloaders in the app store in connection with the BankBot Anubis malware could suggest that: A given malware distributor/cybercrime faction has shifted from using Marcher to distributing <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1>; or The threat actors distributing the malware on Google Play are offering their “expertise” as a service, spreading malware downloaders for different cybercrime factions that use mobile Trojans to facilitate financial fraud — aka “downloader-as-a-service.” Such cybercrime services are common in the fraud and malware black markets. They entail a proven ability to infiltrate Google Play and plant malicious downloaders under the guise of benign-looking apps. These services can likely maintain the downloader’s C&C servers long enough to generate a steady stream of new infections, suggesting the thought-out operational security and know-how characteristic of organized cybercrime groups. An Era of Mobile Malware Downloaders As app store operators layer security to stymie the efforts of malicious developers, black-hat app distributors find ways to sidestep them. To circumvent ever-evolving app store defenses, mobile malware distributors rely on a strategy from the PC malware realms: Instead of uploading the actual malware to the store, which can result in sampling and detection at a very early stage in the distribution chain, they upload a downloader that may seem rather innocuous compared to actual malware. In general, a downloader app is more likely to survive security checks and recurring scans, and once it lands on a user’s device, it can fetch the intended malware app. As the Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote in “The Art of War,” “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.” Sample Downloader Campaign From Current Analyses In the current campaign, according to X-Force researchers, the downloader apps target <e2>Turkish</e2>-speaking users.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira <e2>Sophos</e2> McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable.
Most of the titles are in English with a handful in Arabic and Russian. <e1>Monokle</e1> has likely been used to spy on individuals in the <e2>Caucasus</e2> regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria.
But <e1>Ginp</e1>’s authors did not stop there, repeatedly replenishing its arsenal with more inventive capabilities. For instance, the malware started using push notifications and pop-up messages to get the victim to open certain apps — those that it can overlay with phishing windows. The notifications are cleverly worded to lull the user into expecting to see a form for entering bank card data.

As seen in Figure 8, this version of <e1>Anubis</e1> is built to run on several iterations of the <e2>Android</e2> operating system, dating back to version 4.
Cerberus, the king of all RATs <e1>Cerberus</e1> is a highly sophisticated <e2>Android</e2> malware, in circulation since 2019.
The <e1>Exodus</e1>-infected iOS apps were signed with Apple-issued enterprise certificates, which allowed victims to install the malicious apps, even from outside the App Store. Apple eventually revoked these certificates. Bauer said that compared to the Android version, which had been under development for at least five years, the iOS variant was far less sophisticated, suggesting it was a newer project. It could only collect and steal contacts, photos, videos, audio recordings, GPS information, and device location. It could also perform on-demand audio recording operations, however, it was nowhere near as intrusive and did not the same level of control of infected devices as the <e2>Android</e2> variant.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “<e1>/[number]”</e1> (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999).

” On the self-signing front, with root access, <e1>Monokle</e1> is capable of installing additional attacker-specified certificates to the trusted certificates on an infected device, “effectively opening up the target and the device to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against TLS traffic,” the researchers wrote. To do this, it remounts system partition to install attacker specified certificate in /system/etc/security/cacerts/). Other functionality includes a cornucopia of classic spyware tricks, such as the ability to harvest contacts and calendar information, record audio and calls, retrieve emails and messages (including from WhatsApp, <e2>Skype</e2> and more), take photos and videos, track device location and take screenshots.

Target types Based on the application types provided by Google, we can see based on the targeted applications that although the <e1>Anubis</e1> Trojan is a banker and therefore mainly targets “Finance” apps, it also has interest in other types of apps. As visible in following chart, the application types in second and third position of interest are <e2>“Shopping” and “Business” apps</e2>, which can be explained by the fact that is shouldn’t look suspicious to the victim when such applications are requesting update of payment details or other sensitive information.

” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain <e1>“XXXX.ru”,</e1> which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider).
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and <e2>Skype</e2> by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration.

All the malicious <e1>Dvmap</e1> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for <e2>Android 5</e2> and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.

This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user’s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols. Push notifications were also used to control audio recording. Lookout has shared information about this family with Apple, and they have revoked the affected certificates. As a result, no new instances of this app can be installed on iOS devices and existing installations can no longer be run. Lookout customers are also protected from this threat on both Android and <e2>iOS</e2>.
The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, <e2>Uber</e2> and more.
In the course of researching the <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>iOS</e2>, Lookout discovered three vulnerabilities Pegasus used to jailbreak the target device, and install and run the malicious software.
In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, <e2>SunTrust</e2> and Wells Fargo,” Balaam said.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate <e2>banking apps</e2> mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign.
Still, it is a recurring problem: In 2017, X-Force mobile researchers reported numerous occasions on which financial malware had sneaked into the Google Play Store, with the <e1>BankBot</e1> <e2>Android</e2> malware family leading the pack.
But once downloaded, <e1>Gooligan</e1> determines which Android phone it's infected and launches the appropriate exploits to "root" the device -- i.e. take complete control over it. To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as VROOT and Towelroot, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, <e2>KitKat</e2> and Lollipop.
Timeline of posts related to the <e1>Hacking Team</e1> DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for <e2>Flash Player</e2> and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump.
For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “/[number]” (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. In this version of Rotexy, dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used. 2016 From mid-2016 on, the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains. No other significant changes were observed in the Trojan’s network behavior. In late 2016, versions of the Trojan emerged that contained the card.html phishing page in the assets/www folder. The page was designed to steal users’ bank card details: 2017–2018 From early 2017, the HTML phishing pages bank.html, update.html and <e1>extortionist.html</e1> started appearing in the assets folder.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, <e2>SunTrust</e2>, and Wells Fargo.
Security researchers have discovered over 17,000 new <e1>Anubis</e1> samples targeting over 377 banking applications spread in 93 countries, including the United States, <e2>Europe</e2>, and India.

The "porn kr sex" APK connects to a malicious website that runs <e1>XLoader</e1> in the background. The website uses a different fixed twitter account (https://twitter.com/fdgoer343). This attack, however, seems exclusive to Android users, as it does not have the code to attack iOS devices. Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms <e2>Instagram</e2> and Tumblr instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address.
A, respectively). <e1>Project Spy</e1> uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates. We also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app after further investigation. However, we have noted a significantly small number of downloads of the app in Pakistan, India, <e2>Afghanistan</e2>, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia.
“Compared to the original Cerberus, <e1>ERMAC</e1> uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest <e2>Cerberus</e2> commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts.
Now in the first month of 2017, Check Point has warned <e2>Android</e2> users that <e1>HummingBad</e1> is back in a big way, this time under the new moniker of HummingWhale.
The list of these original features is very limited compared to recent banking Trojans but enough to steal personal information from the victims: Overlaying: Dynamic - C2 based (possibility to remotely modify the list of targeted application) SMS blocking (hiding messages from the victim) SMS sending (capability to send messages from the infected device) SMS harvesting (possibility to send a copy of all message to the C2 server) About <e1>Anubis</e1> Rise of <e2>maza-in</e2> By publishing the aforementioned article, maza-in earned himself a reputation of Android expert on underground forums.
But new data published today by Citizen Lab researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the <e1>Pegasus</e1> spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, Canada, <e2>Switzerland</e2>, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place.
<e1>DroidJack</e1>: The Stalker's App Targeting Android Users An international cybercrime investigation is currently underway to target malicious users of spy software targeting <e2>Android</e2> users, known as DroidJack.
How Ginp’s Overlay Attack Works in Practice Our team has studied how Ginp operators deploy the fake overlay pages to victims’ mobile devices. When <e1>Ginp</e1> starts running, it first obtains information from the victim’s device, such as the state of the device and the currently installed applications, and sends it to the server. Based on this information, the server will then decide how to proceed—usually discovering which <e2>banking application</e2> the victim uses, and then initiating an attack.
It’s interesting that <e1>Triout</e1>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from <e2>Israel</e2>. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated.
0 banking malware, hackers start to plunder your account to make unauthorised purchases or money transfers, and your bank can’t get hold of you if they suspect something suspicious is occurring. <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> is said to work on phones running Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) and earlier. As always, you would be wise to be cautious of what apps you install on your Android device – particularly if they are sourced from unofficial app marketplaces. Whether they are breaking into <e2>social media</e2> profiles to post spam or raiding online bank accounts to steal money, criminals are dead-set on exploiting innocent people’s mobile devices to make money.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo. Chunghwa Post - The government-owned corporation Chunghwa is the official postal service of Taiwan. Swiss Post - The national postal service of Switzerland, a fully state-owned limited company (AG) regulated by public law. The fake applications are built using WebView, a popular extension of <e2>Android</e2>’s View class that lets the developer show a webpage.
Throughout 2017, many actors used <e2>Bankbot</e2> for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique <e1>CometBot</e1> (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.
Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e2>DualToy</e2> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, <e1>insapp.ini,</e1> which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, <e2>SnapTune Vid</e2>, Abfix and Office Scanner.
This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. <e1>XLoader</e1> linked to <e2>Yanbian</e2> hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang.
In the case of <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>iOS</e2>, if the zero-day attack execution failed to jailbreak the device, the attack sequence failed overall.
The app was connected to a command-and-control server (C2), which issued a new command to download the additional malicious Android Application Package (APK), Cerberus. <e1>Cerberus</e1> has various spying and credential-theft functionalities. It can sit over an existing <e2>banking app</e2> and wait for the user to log into their bank account.
After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in <e2>Japan</e2>, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
An investigation into the malware revealed <e2>NSO</e2>, an Israeli-based organization owned by U.S. company Francisco Partners Management, likely crafted <e1>Pegasus</e1> to further its "cyber war" line of products.
However, there is also an English version of the <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> app (see Figure 3) besides the Portuguese one, and that app has neither geographical nor language restrictions. Playing further off the suggested <e2>GAS Tecnologia</e2> link, the app promises better security for its users.

So far, <e1>DualToy</e1> mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an <e2>iOS</e2> device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad.
” The ViceLeaker APK implements very common spyware features (exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs, and device information) along with backdoor capabilities (upload, download, delete files, camera takeover, and record surrounding audio). <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> leverages HTTP for C&C communications and to transfer exfiltrated data. During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “Conversations.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app. The modified Conversations app mimics Telegram messenger, but experts did not find any malicious activity implemented by this specific app. “Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the <e2>Conversations app</e2>, used to infect victims, we didn’t discover anything malicious in it,” continues Kaspersky.
Project Spy routine At the end of March 2020, we came across an app masquerading as a <e2>coronavirus update app</e2>, which we named <e1>Project Spy</e1> based on the login page of its backend server.

Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

There are the following relevant detection paths (the last one is an alternative <e2>Telegram</e2> client – “Telegram X“): This would be a very unusual coincidence. Even when a false flag might also be a possibility, we consider this to be unlikely. The samples sharing this overlap are modified versions of an open source Jabber/XMPP client called “Conversations” with some code additions. The legitimate version of this app is also available on Google Play. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.
Although <e1>Alien</e1> comes from a different version than the one released, it retains many of the functions that make this type of malware dangerous. First of all, it’s a very streamlined RAT with tons of features. It is also capable of running its own <e2>TeamViewer</e2> instance, and of displaying fake logins for more than 226 applications.
But the modern version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> Trojan (Malware) combines the functionality of Banking Trojan and Ransomware. It spreads using the name of <e1>Avito.pay.apk</e1> and downloads from websites with names like youla9d6h.
From our analysis of the TrickMo mobile malware, it is apparent that <e1>TrickMo</e1> is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in <e2>Germany</e2>. Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks.
For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “<e1>DualToy</e1>” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and <e2>iOS</e2> devices via a USB connection.

By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on Google Play. The developer name used, <e2>GAS Brazil</e2>, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users.
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted South Korean and Japanese speakers.

Previously in 2015, we saw the Rootnik Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file /data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip which contains all the rooting exploits. If there is no such file, the malware will download it from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip. The file integrity is then inspected by comparing the MD5 value of the downloaded file and the pre-calculated one from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/md5.txt. Unzips the downloaded file to the app’s data directory and attempt to gain root privilege by systematically executing the exploits one by one. Installs busybox and remounts system partition as read-write by running a sequence of shell commands with superuser permission. The downloaded file “raw.zip” contains the exploits from “<e2>Baidu Easy Root</e2>” version 2.

TrickBot Mobile App Bypasses 2‐Factor Authentication for Net Banking Services The malware authors behind <e1>TrickBot</e1> banking Trojan have developed a new <e2>Android</e2> app that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to Internet banking customers via SMS or relatively more secure push notifications, and complete fraudulent transactions.
New <e1>TangleBot</e1> malware is targeting Android devices in the US and Canada A cyber security company, Proofpoint/Cloudmark has recently identified a new threat that can take over the victim’s mobile phone through SMS. The threat has been found in the <e2>United States</e2> and in Canada and as per the reports, Android users are the main target of this malware.
Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A <e2>Connexxa</e2> engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of <e1>Exodus</e1>. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers.
Report: <e2>NSO Group</e2>'s <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday.
0 Android Trojan that first came to light last year is being advertised on underground sites for anyone to rent. <e1>Red Alert</e1> is capable of stealing tons of sensitive information from infected mobile devices including SMS messages, contact details, information about WiFi networks, call logs, and data about current or recently running tasks. It can also initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm, block calls from banks and connect with bots via Twitter in case its command and control server (C&C) happens to go offline. Researchers said the malware has a UI to enable the device admin access, and does not allow the user to disable it once enabled. “The malware sets itself up as a default telephony provider, mostly for intercepting SMS messages,” researchers said. “A list of phone numbers to be intercepted can be controlled by the C&C server. Messages from these numbers may be hidden from the user. Intercepted messages are also sent to the C&C server. This could be used for intercepting 2 factor authentication codes used by most services these days including online banking.” Once the malware has full access to the infected device, it can even wipe out all data from the device. The malware is shipped via spam emails delivering .APK (Android Package Kit) attachments and it targets Android devices running <e2>Android marshmallow</e2> and later.
These fake overlays have not previously been noted in the security community. <e1>Ginp</e1>’s new targeting strategy echoes other mobile banking malware families, which have also expanded target sets to include Turkish banking customers. Cybercriminals appear to be finding this geographical region fruitful for cyber operations. Some observers have attributed this to obsolete systems and widespread poor security management. It also is possible that cybercriminals developing these overlays have recently made several options targeting <e2>Turkish banks</e2> available on the dark web, which have become a popular commodity in those forums, including for Ginp operators.
Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps. The spyware can now record victims’ screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in <e2>WhatsApp</e2> and read text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype and Messenger.

Dubbed <e1>Judy</e1>, due to many of the apps containing a character of the same name, the malicious code was installed when the applications were downloaded. Researchers at Checkpoint spotted the malware and say it was hosted on apps created by Korean developers Kiniwini, registered as ENISTUDIO Corp. These included Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, <e2>Judy’s Happy House</e2>, and Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess.
In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> was spotted in a <e2>Google Play Store</e2> app called Dardesh.

Exodus: New Android Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named <e1>Exodus</e1>, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two. We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>, disguised as service applications from mobile operators.
This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside <e2>Apple’s app store</e2> was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system.
The spyware has a File Manager feature allowing access to files like application data, pictures, downloads, and others, that are kept in the external storage: <e2>SpyNote</e2> has a location tracking feature based on GPS and network data. The location data is obtained by registering LocationListener using requestLocationUpdates method from LocationManager class. Moreover, a remote command can be issued to capture audio or camera feed. The code is designed to allow live footage to be obtained from all cameras available on a device with additional capabilities like zoom, flash etc. The collected data exfiltration is achieved over the command and control channel. All commands and data are sent via the normal communications channel. All traffic sent by a victim's device is compressed before being sent using <e1>java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream</e1> class: Command and control (C2, C&C) traffic is sent over an uncommonly used port tcp/215, but it is also possible for SpyNote to communicate via any other TCP port.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file <e1>“mms.apk”</e1> and all use the domain “XXXX.
Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the U.S, U.K, Australia, Canada, Germany, <e2>France</e2>, India and Italy, according to researchers.
Hacking Team Spying Tool Listens to Calls Following news that iOS devices are at risk of spyware related to the <e1>Hacking Team</e1>, the saga continues into the <e2>Android</e2> sphere.
Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, <e2>France</e2>, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
According to security firm Wandera the malware, dubbed <e1>RedDrop</e1>, is being distributed inside 53 <e2>Android</e2> applications promoted on third-party app stores.
“We believe that <e1>TrickMo</e1>’s most significant novelty is an app-recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by <e2>German banks</e2>,” they said.
As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to <e2>Spain</e2>, Turkey, Germany, United States of America, Italy, France, Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and <e1>Game642.res</e1> – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. <e2>Yamato Transport</e2> - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: <e1>google.servlce.store</e1> gooogle.

Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called <e1>Ahrar Maps</e1> made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with <e2>Ahrar al-Sham</e2>. “There is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,” according to the report.
Despite <e1>Ginp</e1>’s expansion to <e2>Turkey</e2>, we assess the group will continue to target Spanish banking customers, as well, based on recent overlay screens our team found on the malware’s C&C server aimed at Spanish banks.

Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. <e1>Monokle</e1> supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, <e2>Facebook messenger</e2>, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Snapchat.
Similarly to another <e2>Android</e2> spyware made in Italy, originally discovered by Lukas Stefanko and later named <e1>Skygofree</e1> and analyzed in depth by Kaspersky Labs, Exodus also takes advantage of "protectedapps", a feature in Huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications.
The interesting thing is this <e2>Android</e2> (<e1>Rotexy</e1>) Trojan malware is targeting mostly Russians, in the last 3 months over 70K users primarily located in Russia has been targeted.
The <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> app made it onto the heavily guarded Google Play store thanks to its extreme stealth. Its creators reduced the app’s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious functionalities but one: abusing Accessibility Service. Accessibility Service is long known to be the Achilles’ heel of the Android operating system. Security solutions can detect it in countless combinations with other suspicious permissions and functions, or malicious functionalities – but when faced with no additional functionality nor permission, all failed to trigger any alarm on DEFENSOR ID. By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official <e2>Android</e2> app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1).

The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Uber and more. The researchers also questioned how effective the strategy of shipping the APK malware was proving to be for its creators. “The malware required the user to OK to install, and Android pops up plenty of warnings about permissions,” researchers said. “Also, Google Play Protect was detecting this threat, so in order to get the malware installed on <e2>Android</e2> we also had to disable Play Protect.
This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of <e1>Android/Twitoor.A,</e1> can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C <e2>Twitter</e2> account to another one.
Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 <e2>banks</e2> from several countries including the U.
The fake applications are built using WebView, a popular extension of Android’s View class that lets the developer show a webpage. <e2>FakeSpy</e2> uses this view to redirect users to the original post office carrier webpage on launch of the application, continuing the deception. This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface. FAKESPY CODE ANALYSIS Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources. This configuration can be toggled on by going to ‘Settings’ -> ‘Security’ -> ‘Unknown Resources’. PackageInstaller shows the app’s permission access and asks for the user's approval, which then installs the application. This analysis dissects FakeSpy’s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions.

The class “org.starsizew.Ac” is designed for this purpose; its only task is to check if the main service is running, and restart the main service if the answer is no. The class “org.starsizew.Tb” also has a self-monitoring mechanism to restart itself when its own onDestroy API is triggered. Other than that, its major functionality is to collect private device information, upload it to a remote C2 server, and handle any commands as requested by the C2 server. All those functions are implemented in asynchronous tasks by “org.starsizew.i”. The class “org.starsizew.Ma” is registered to intercept incoming SMS messages, the arrival of which will trigger the Android system to call its “onReceive” API. Its major functionality is also implemented through the call of the asynchronous task (“org.starsizew.i”), including uploading the incoming SMS messages to the remote C2 server and executing any commands as instructed by the remote attacker. C2 Communication The C2 communication includes two parts: sending information to the remote HTTP server and parsing the server’s response to execute any commands as instructed by the remote attackers. The functionality for these two parts is implemented by doInBackground and onPostExecute respectively, two API methods of “android.os.AsyncTask” as extended by class <e1>“org.starsizew.i”.</e1> As seen from the major code body of method doInBackground shown in Figure 3 (some of the original classes and methods are renamed for easier understanding), there are three calls to HttpPost with different contents as parameters.

<e1>RCSAndroid</e1> — Advanced Android Hacking Tool Leaked Online As digging deeper and deeper into the huge <e2>Hacking Team</e2> data dump, security researchers are finding more and more source code, including an advanced Android Hacking Tool.
<e1>Cerberus</e1> Banking Trojan Unleashed on <e2>Google Play</e2> The Cerberus malware can steal banking credentials, bypass security measures and access text messages.
<e1>FakeSpy</e1> Masquerades as <e2>Postal Service Apps</e2> Around the World KEY FINDINGS The Cybereason Nocturnus team is investigating a new campaign involving FakeSpy, an Android mobile malware that emerged around October 2017.
Several of the main components of <e2>RuMMS</e2> are shown in Figure 2. The activity class <e1>“org.starsizew.MainActivity”</e1> executes when the app is started.
0 Android Trojan that first came to light last year is being advertised on underground sites for anyone to rent. <e1>Red Alert</e1> is capable of stealing tons of sensitive information from infected mobile devices including SMS messages, contact details, information about WiFi networks, call logs, and data about current or recently running tasks. It can also initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm, block calls from banks and connect with bots via Twitter in case its command and control server (C&C) happens to go offline. Researchers said the malware has a UI to enable the device admin access, and does not allow the user to disable it once enabled. “The malware sets itself up as a default telephony provider, mostly for intercepting SMS messages,” researchers said. “A list of phone numbers to be intercepted can be controlled by the C&C server. Messages from these numbers may be hidden from the user. Intercepted messages are also sent to the C&C server. This could be used for intercepting 2 factor authentication codes used by most services these days including <e2>online banking</e2>.” Once the malware has full access to the infected device, it can even wipe out all data from the device.
According to researchers, <e1>Cerberus</e1> already contains overlay attack templates for a total of 30 unique targets, including: 7 French banking apps 7 U.S. banking apps 1 Japanese banking app 15 <e2>non-banking apps</e2> Cerberus Uses Motion-based Evasion Tactic Cerberus also uses some interesting techniques to evade detection from antivirus solutions and prevent its analysis, like using the device accelerometer sensor to measure movements of the victim.
Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps. The spyware can now record victims’ screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read text of notifications from social media apps, including <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Facebook, Skype and Messenger.
<e1>ERMAC</e1> is a new <e2>Android</e2> banking Trojan that can steal financial data from 378 banking and wallet apps.
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted South Korean and Japanese speakers. However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like China, Taiwan, <e2>France</e2>, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, and others.
<e1>FakeSpy</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Malware Disguised as Postal Service Messages The operators behind an updated version of the FakeSpy malware are targeting Android devices using SMS phishing messages to spread the info stealer, according to the security firm Cybereason.
Along with the malicious DEFENSOR ID app, another malicious app named <e1>Defensor Digital</e1> was discovered. Both apps shared the same C&C server, but we couldn’t investigate the latter as it had already been removed from the <e2>Google Play</e2> store.
“The app is yet another third party iOS <e2>App Store</e2> just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver.
Perhaps more information on <e1>XLoader</e1> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

<e2>Coronavirus Update App</e2> Leads to <e1>Project Spy</e1> Android and iOS Spyware We discovered a potential cyberespionage campaign, which we have named Project Spy, that infects Android and iOS devices with spyware (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_ProjectSpy.
Dynamic Analysis of <e2>Cerberus</e2> By Bogdan Anghelache, specialist threat researcher, Avira Protection Labs Behavior upon installation Corona-Apps.apk variant has a very aggressive behavior after installation. A high level overview can be read on Avira’s blog. Communication with the C&C server After installation, network traffic can be seen between the application and the C&C server <e1>‘botduke1.ug’</e1> The application has a well defined set of commands such as: “info_device”, “new_device”, “saved_data_device” and “pause_attacker”.
4 and newer, it appears that <e1>Evil Eye</e1> is likely having success with these attacks. According to Apple's own statistics from its website: 43% of iPad devices using the App store use <e2>iOS 12</e2> or earlier 30% of iPhone devices using the App store use iOS 12 or earlier This represents a considerable attack surface of potentially vulnerable devices.
The immediate consequence to this, is that <e1>TangleBot</e1> gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications. The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things. Furthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the Android operating system. The NCC, therefore, wishes to, once again, urge millions of telecom consumers in <e2>Nigeria</e2> to be wary of such wiles of cyber criminals, whose intent is to defraud unsuspecting Internet users.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting <e2>US</e2> banks including Bank of America, U.
This most recent <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaign appears to target users of <e2>postal services</e2> around the world.
Disguising malware as a legitimate mobile app is a hallmark of <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1>. The last major campaign from the threat group was seen two years ago with a banking trojan disguised as <e2>Google</e2> or Chrome that also targeted Android device users around the globe.
EXODUS ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named <e1>Exodus</e1> and was developed by Italian app maker Connexxa, a known provider of surveillance tools to <e2>Italian</e2> authorities.
A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices. <e1>Hacking Team</e1> has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and <e2>CVE-2013-6282</e2> in their attacks.

Dubbed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> (Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Viber, and updates for both Android and Flash Player.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and <e2>CoinBase</e2> among others.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, <e2>Taobao</e2>, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
A malicious Android app has been uncovered on the Google Play app marketplace that is distributing the banking trojan, <e1>Cerberus</e1>. The app has 10,000 downloads. Researchers said that the trojan was found within the last few days, as it was being spread via a Spanish currency converter app (called “Calculadora de Moneda”), which has been available to Android users in <e2>Spain</e2> since March.

Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, <e2>Telegram</e2> Messages The Android malware comes from threat group <e1>APT-C-23</e1>, also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion.
Once fully installed, <e1>Exodus</e1> was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with <e2>Samsung phones</e2>) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, <e2>Twitter</e2>, Viber, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.
Researchers say they have uncovered a new <e2>Android</e2> spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram. The malware, <e1>Android/SpyC32.A</e1>, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East.
]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, Bankia, <e2>BBVA</e2>, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, Santander, and Kutxabank.
In this blog, we showed that the threat actor behind the recent <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaign is a Chinese-speaking group called “<e2>Roaming Mantis</e2>” known to operate mainly in Asia.

The newer version of <e2>FakeSpy</e2> uses new URL addresses for malicious communication with FakeSpy. The function main uses a DES encryption algorithm to encode these addresses. The examples below show the plaintext key “TEST” to decrypt encoded hexadecimal strings <e1>(jUtils.decrypt()).</e1> These encoded strings contain the new URL addresses not seen in older versions of FakeSpy.
Also, the C&C infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families. “The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like Pegasus or FinFisher,” the researchers pointed out.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: google.servlce.store gooogle.services <e1>goooogle.services</e1> play.

This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user’s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The <e2>iOS</e2> apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols.
According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, <e2>China</e2> reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the U.

What’s going on? <e1>Ginp</e1> malware was first discovered in 2019 and started as an SMS stealer. However, it soon upgraded itself to being one of the most advanced financial fraud landscape actors. Its target set consists mostly of customers of Spanish banks; nevertheless, the operators are planning on evolving their strategies to propagate in Turkey. Know the history The initial version of the malware masqueraded as a Google Play Verificator app. In August 2019, a new variant was launched with banking-specific capabilities, disguised as fake Adobe Flash Player apps. The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with Viber and Snapchat. By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the Anubis trojan source code. Evolving capabilities With the operators’ plan to spread the trojan to <e2>Turkey</e2>, the following capabilities are worth a mention: Notifications blockers service RAT capabilities Injections locker How to stay safe?

Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps. The spyware can now record victims’ screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook, <e2>Skype</e2> and Messenger.
Dubbed <e1>Skygofree</e1>, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.” Surveillance capabilities Although the Android malware has numerous creepy spying capabilities, 48 different commands in the latest implant, Kaspersky described the “geofence” command as one of the most notable features. A location can be specified so that when the victim’s device matches that location, “the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.” The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured. Kaspersky gives examples of how it steals <e2>Facebook</e2> data, Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, Viber and LINE for free calls and messages.

Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the <e2>United Kingdom</e2> and the United States.

In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, Caixa Bank, <e2>EVO Banco</e2>, Santander, and Kutxabank.

Local and Remote Shells In order to execute commands on the infected devices, as well as to provide a reverse shell to the Command & Control operators, <e2>Exodus</e2> Two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null. Once launched, null will first verify whether it is able to fork on the system and that there is no other instance of itself currently running by checking whether the local port number 6842 is available. This payload will then attempt to instantiate a remote reverse /system/bin/sh shell to the Command & Control ws.my-local-weather[.]com on port 22011. It is worth noticing that this remote reverse shell does not employ any transport cryptography. The traffic transits in clear and is therefore potentially exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks: At the same time, null will also bind a local shell on <e1>0.0.0.0:6842.</e1> This local port is used by Exodus Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases.

The newly uncovered banking <e1>Alien</e1> trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials! When it has infected a device, the RAT tries to take passwords from at least 226 mobile applications; including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking & Capital One Mobile, as well as many collaboration & social apps e.g. <e2>Snapchat</e2>, Telegram & Microsoft Outlook.

However, some users, especially those who want to install Android apps from a PC or Mac, or who want to do advanced operations with their Android devices, This is because ADB is both the only official interface for a Windows or Mac computer to operate an Android device via USB and it is a debugging interface. Install ADB drivers Once loaded, the module will first download universal Windows ADB drivers from its C2 server (e.g., from http[:]//www.zaccl.com/tool/new_tool.zip) and install them. Then, some variants will directly drop a file named adb.exe which is the standard ADB Windows client. Other variants have compiled the ADB client’s source code into the module so that they could also perform ADB operations. Instead of adb.exe, the newest variant will drop tadb.exe, a customized ADB client from Tencent’s Android management software. Note that since version 4.2 (released in early 2013), Android requires a user’s manual confirmation to authorize a PC before building an ADB session. This was designed to prevent attacks such as sideloading apps via USB. However, if a user has authorized his PC in the past, the related key files will be stored in the <e1>%HOME%/.android</e1> directory on the PC.

Perhaps more information on <e1>XLoader</e1> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Security Alert: <e2>Mazar BOT</e2> – the Android Malware That Can Erase Your Phone Our team at Heimdal Security has recently analyzed a text message sent to random mobile numbers. The Geographical extent is so far unknown, so please exercise caution. The SMS / MMS in question arrives with the following contents (sanitized by Heimdal Security): If the APK (which is a program file for Android) is run on an Android-powered smartphone, then it will gain administrator rights on the victim’s device. This will allow the attackers to: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Our team has identified the malicious APK to be the <e1>Mazar Android BOT</e1>, a threat also that Recorded Future spotted in November 2015.

The new variants are also able to detect if they are running on virtual machines (VMs), a common way for researchers to safely unpack and analyze malware. In <e1>Anubis</e1>' case, this also includes <e2>Android</e2> emulators such as Genymotion.
After gaining root privilege, <e2>SpyDealer</e2> takes steps to maintain persistence on the compromised device. It first drops a native executable file powermanager to its own data directory (Figure 6.) Once executed, powermanager creates a backup the app’s APK file to /system/bin/update_1.apk. Whenever the app is uninstalled (Figure 7,) the running powermanager will copy the APK file from /system/bin/update_1.apk to <e1>/system/app/Update.apk</e1>, resulting in the Trojan running as a system app (Figure 8.
“Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of <e1>Monokle</e1>: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘<e2>UzbekChat</e2>’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.
" While <e1>Monokle</e1> currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and <e2>Georgia</e2> -- as well as targets in Syria.
A TrickMo Kill Switch One of the most interesting features of the <e2>TrickMo</e2> malware is having its own kill switch. Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo’s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the “4” key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You’re Infected? The following SMS message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key: HrLbpr3x/htAVnAgYepBuH2xmFDb68TYTt7FwGn0ddGlQJv/hqsctL57ocFU0Oz3L+uhLcOGG7GVBAfHKL1TBQ== Sending this SMS will trigger TrickMo’s kill switch by sending the string “4” encrypted with the generated RSA public key and base64 encoded.

The campaign seeks to deliver Anubis, a particularly nasty piece of malware that was originally used for cyber espionage and retooled as a banking trojan. <e1>Anubis</e1> can completely hijack an Android mobile device, steal data, record phone calls, and even hold the device to ransom by encrypting the victim’s personal files. With mobile devices increasingly used in the corporate environment, thanks to the popularity of BYOD policies, this malware has the potential to cause serious harm, mostly to consumers, and businesses that allow the installation of unsigned applications. Here’s how it works: At first glance, the email shown in Figure 1 looks like any other phishing email that asks the user to download an invoice. However, this particular email downloads an Android Package Kit (APK), which is the common format used by Android to distribute and install applications. Let’s take a closer look at the suspicious file. When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file (Fattura002873.apk), is downloaded. Upon opening the file, the user is asked to enable “Google Play Protect” as shown in Figure 2. However, this is not a genuine “Google Play Protect” screen; instead it gives the app all the permissions it needs while simultaneously disabling the actual Google Play Protect. A closer look at the code reveals the application gathers a list of installed applications to compare the results against a list of targeted applications (Figure 4). The malware mainly targets banking and financial applications, but also looks for popular <e2>shopping apps</e2> such as eBay or Amazon.
Although <e1>Alien</e1> comes from a different version than the one released, it retains many of the functions that make this type of malware dangerous. First of all, it’s a very streamlined RAT with tons of features. It is also capable of running its own TeamViewer instance, and of displaying fake logins for more than 226 applications. These include not only banking apps, but <e2>social media</e2>, email, and even popular cryptocurrency wallets.

" Cerberus is not seen as "moving the needle" for trojan capabilities, but it's dangerous nonetheless. "<e1>Cerberus</e1> should not be taken lightly," ThreatFabric warns. It can harvest contacts, send messages, steal credentials. And its overlays are not limited to banking apps—it can attack messaging or other accounts using the same techniques. The rental model is interesting—it ensures the malware can evolve and spread quickly, and it increases the likely damage during its lifespan. There is also the question of the apps coverage thus far—U.S., <e2>France</e2> and Japan.
Geography of Rotexy attacks According to our data, 98% of all <e2>Rotexy</e2> attacks target users in Russia. Indeed, the Trojan explicitly targets Russian-speaking users. There have also been cases of users in Ukraine, Germany, Turkey and several other countries being affected. Kaspersky Internet Security for Android and the Sberbank Online app securely protect users against attacks by this Trojan.

The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, <e2>France</e2>, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy.
While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download <e1>RCSAndroid</e1>. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for <e2>arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825)</e2> and heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871) vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.
Not only that, but the threat actors could use a simple overlay in <e1>Cerberus</e1> requiring its victims to unlock their device. The overlay analyzed by researchers stole victims’ screen lock codes/credentials, allowing the threat actors to remotely unlock a device for the purpose of performing fraud. Attackers could also abuse the <e2>Accessibility features</e2> to steal 2FA codes from the Google Authentication app for the purpose of bypassing authentication services.
In the latest activity identified by Volexity, the <e1>Evil Eye</e1> threat actor used an open source framework called IRONSQUIRREL to launch their exploit chain. The exploits used targeted Apple iOS operating systems leveraging a vulnerability in WebKit that appears to have been patched in the summer of 2019. The exploit works against <e2>iOS versions 12.3, 12.3.1, and 12.3.2</e2>. These versions of iOS are newer than anything mentioned in the Google Project Zero blog, or any other recently published reports involving weaponized exploits that can be used remotely against iPhones or iPads.
As researchers from SfyLabs detail, <e1>RedAlert 2.0</e1> targets over 60 Android <e2>banking and social apps</e2>. When a potential victim opens one the targeted apps on their Android device, the malware overlays an appropriate dialog, enticing users to re-enter their login details.

All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. <e2>La Poste</e2> - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France.
Perhaps the malware’s most troubling capability, <e1>SpyNote</e1> allows the attacker to execute commands. “Command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim’s device. Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day,” Shivang Desai, a researcher with the firm wrote Tuesday. When it comes to surveillance, the RAT can take screen captures – and by taking advantage of the way the device handles audio – record conversations. According to researchers the malware hijacks the MediaProjection.Callback API, something first introduced in <e2>Android 5.0 Lollipop</e2>, to record audio.
Coronavirus Update App Leads to Project Spy Android and iOS Spyware We discovered a potential cyberespionage campaign, which we have named <e2>Project Spy</e2>, that infects Android and iOS devices with spyware (detected by Trend Micro as <e1>AndroidOS_ProjectSpy.HRX</e1> and IOS_ProjectSpy.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in <e1>mike.jar,</e1> some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges.

As anticipated, <e1>Monokle</e1> was developed by STC, the experts noticed that Monokle and the <e2>STC</e2>’s Android security suite called Defender are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure.
According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. "<e1>Gooligan</e1> potentially affects devices on Android 4 Jelly Bean and KitKat, and 5 <e2>Lollipop</e2>, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today.
Ongoing activity While monitoring this particular threat, we found another <e1>XLoader</e1> variant posing as a pornography app aimed at <e2>South Korean</e2> users.
The suspect has now been released on bail. <e1>DroidJack</e1> has a large potential victim base—there are reportedly more than one billion <e2>Android</e2> users across the world.

However, we discovered another Android app with a similar package name <e1>“com.mgr.micorsoft”.</e1> Due to the same typo (“micorsoft”) and same binary code fingerprints, we believe these two apps have the same sources and likely have identical functionalities. The app embedded a modified SU daemon program which was re-compiled from SuperSU project’s source code. We named this specific Android Trojan “<e2>RootAngel</e2>”.
On iOS devices, <e1>DualToy</e1> installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their <e2>iTunes</e2> username and password.
Researchers from Threatfabric found in July a new Android banking trojan dubbed <e1>ERMAC</e1> that is almost fully based on the popular banking trojan <e2>Cerberus</e2>. The source code of Cerberus was released in September 2020 on underground hacking forums after its operators failed an auction.
According to the experts, <e1>ERMAC</e1> is operated by threat actors behind the BlackRock mobile malware. On August 17, two forum members named “ermac” and “DukeEugene” started advertising the malware. “DukeEugene”, posted the following message in his account: “Android botnet ERMAC. I will rent a new android botnet with wide functionality to a narrow circle of people (10 people). 3k$ per month. Details in PM.” <e2>DukeEugene</e2> is threat actor known to be behind the BlackRock banking Trojan.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, <e2>China</e2>, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
But once downloaded, <e1>Gooligan</e1> determines which Android phone it's infected and launches the appropriate exploits to "root" the device -- i.e. take complete control over it. To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as VROOT and Towelroot, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, KitKat and Lollipop. Together, those operating systems account for 74 per cent of Android devices in use today, totalling around 1.03 billion. Most infections (40 per cent) are in <e2>Asia</e2>, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in North America, Shaulov said.
Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The <e2>Android</e2> malware comes from threat group <e1>APT-C-23</e1>, also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion.
” Given that the <e1>RCS Android</e1> source code is now available to everybody, it will likely not take long for Android malware with some, most, or all of these capabilities to pop up and be sold on underground forums, and for all Android users to be in danger. So what can they do? Disabling app installations from unknown, third-party sources is one way to minimize the risk. Updating their <e2>Android</e2> device as soon as a new version comes out is also a good way to prevent existing exploits from working and saddling them with malware.
A, respectively). <e1>Project Spy</e1> uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates. We also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app after further investigation. However, we have noted a significantly small number of downloads of the app in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, <e2>Romania</e2>, Grenada, and Russia.
The malware, known as <e1>Pegasus</e1> (or Trident), was created by Israeli cyber-security firm NSO Group and has been around for at least three years --when it was first detailed in a report over the summer of 2016. The malware can operate on both <e2>Android</e2> and iOS devices, albeit it's been mostly spotted in campaigns targeting iPhone users primarily.
When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious <e2>RCSAndroid</e2> agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as <e1>ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A</e1>, which was designed to bypass Google Play.

Previously in 2015, we saw the Rootnik Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file /data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip which contains all the rooting exploits. If there is no such file, the malware will download it from <e1>http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip.</e1> The file integrity is then inspected by comparing the MD5 value of the downloaded file and the pre-calculated one from http[:]//yangxiu2014.
This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that <e1>Anubis</e1> itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available <e2>BankBot</e2> code.

Disguising malware as a legitimate mobile app is a hallmark of <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1>. The last major campaign from the threat group was seen two years ago with a banking trojan disguised as Google or Chrome that also targeted <e2>Android</e2> device users around the globe.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including <e2>Bankinter</e2>, Bankia, BBVA, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, Santander, and Kutxabank.
Maybe the news that police have raided and searched at least thirteen homes in a pan-European investigation will make some potential <e1>DroidJack</e1> purchasers think twice. According to reports, action was taken in the United Kingdom, <e2>France</e2>, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, targeting people who had bought DroidJack and used it since 2014.
It evolved from an SMS based spyware that was active in 2014. <e2>Rotexy</e2> malware evaluation was at a peak in 2014 & 2015 and it mainly using the phishing links in order to compromise the users that prompt to install the malicious apps. It uses the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service, malicious C&C server, and incoming SMS messages to reach the victim’s devices. The main function of this mobile malware is the banking Trojan and ransomware which is distributed in name of AvitoPay.apk. It using the various download from various malicious websites including youla9d6h.tk, prodam8n9.tk, <e1>prodamfkz.ml,</e1> avitoe0ys.
Recently, Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered an advanced <e2>Android</e2> malware we’ve named “<e1>SpyDealer</e1>” which exfiltrates private data from more than 40 apps and steals sensitive messages from communication apps by abusing the Android accessibility service feature.
This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the <e2>iOS</e2> App Store.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. <e1>Port 6206</e1>: Skype extraction service.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration.

New XLoader Variant Masquerades as Android Security Apps, iOS Configuration Profile A new variant of <e1>XLoader</e1> is masquerading as Android security apps and an iOS configuration profile to target mobile users. Trend Micro detected the variant while analyzing a smishing campaign that tricked mobile users into visiting one of several fake websites, including a clone of a <e2>Japanese mobile phone operator</e2>. Whenever an Android user visited a malicious site and/or pressed any of the available buttons, the campaign triggered the download of an Android Package (APK) for fake security software (assuming the user has enabled the installation of third-party apps in their Unknown Sources settings).

Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers. This trojan force users to enter only right credentials and it checks all the details against the data that it already received. Once the victim entered all the data then it checks the originality of the data and uploaded into C&C server.

The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample. A subsequent investigation revealed that the spyware has the following capabilities: Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php) Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php) Has capability to hide self Can send all call logs (“<e1>content://call_log/calls</e1>”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.

Malware Features Android According to the observed samples and their signatures, early versions of this Android malware were developed by the end of 2014 and the campaign has remained active ever since. The code and functionality have changed numerous times; from simple unobfuscated malware at the beginning to sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device. We have examined all the detected versions, including the latest one that is signed by a certificate valid from September 14, 2017. The implant provides the ability to grab a lot of exfiltrated data, like call records, text messages, geolocation, surrounding audio, calendar events, and other memory information stored on the device. After manual launch, it shows a fake welcome notification to the user: Dear Customer, we’re updating your configuration and it will be ready as soon as possible. At the same time, it hides an icon and starts background services to hide further actions from the user.

]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms <e2>Instagram</e2> and Tumblr instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address. We labeled this new variant <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, <e2>Viber</e2>, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
<e1>Triout</e1> - Spyware Framework for Android with Extensive Surveillance Capabilities No operating system is safe from malware, as cyber criminals will always want to steal, spy or tamper with your data. The proliferation of <e2>Android</e2> devices – from smartphones to tablets and smart TVs – has opened up new possibilities for malware developers, as all these devices pack microphones, cameras and location-tracking hardware they can turn into the perfect spy tools.
Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called <e2>WeMessage</e2>, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name.
<e1>Anubis</e1> Strikes Again: Mobile Malware Continues to Plague Users in Official App Stores IBM X-Force mobile malware researchers have observed several developers actively uploading <e2>Android</e2> malware downloaders to the Google Play Store.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo. Chunghwa Post - The government-owned corporation Chunghwa is the official postal service of Taiwan. <e2>Swiss Post</e2> - The national postal service of Switzerland, a fully state-owned limited company (AG) regulated by public law.
Researchers note that XLoader has been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called the Yanbian Gang. <e1>XLoader</e1> is a backdoor trojan and <e2>Android</e2> malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

The <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware Triout. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and <e2>WhatsApp</e2> messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults.
FireEye experts noted: “So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider).” “The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, <e1>mmsmtsh5</e1>, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.
The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in <e2>Palestine</e2> and has also been highlighted by other researchers.

Another app takes two malware types, called <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in <e2>Palestine</e2>. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout.
Ghost Push <e1>Gooligan</e1> is a variant of an old piece of malware known as <e2>Ghost Push</e2> that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year.
Specifically, our team discovered new <e1>Ginp</e1> overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing on the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2). These overlay pages are spoofs of legitimate banking pages, meant to deceive mobile device users into sharing confidential banking and other information. Several of these fake overlays mimic banks in Turkey, suggesting that malware operators intend to use these pages in future campaigns to target customers of <e2>Turkish banks</e2>. These fake overlays have not previously been noted in the security community.

Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, <e1>Mandrake</e1> won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. For unknown reasons, it also avoids installing itself on phones with Verizon SIM cards, or SIM cards from a top Chinese cellular carrier. Its primary target appears to be <e2>Australia</e2>, followed by North America, western Europe (and Poland) and some of the richer parts of South America.
The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, <e2>Viber</e2>, Skype, Uber and more.

Our analysis shows that <e2>SpyDealer</e2> is currently under active development. There are three versions of this malware currently in the wild, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. Starting from 1.9.3, content of configuration files and almost all constant strings in the code are encrypted or encoded. An accessibility service was also introduced in 1.9.3 to steal targeted apps’ messages. According to our dataset, most of these samples use the app name “<e1>GoogleService</e1>” or “GoogleUpdate”.
However, DualToy assumes any physically connected mobile devices will belong to the same owner as the infected PC to which they are connected, which means the pairing is likely already authorized. <e1>DualToy</e1> tries to reuse existing pairing records to directly interact with mobile devices in the background. Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, <e2>iOS</e2> sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms.
Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called <e1>Ahrar Maps</e1> made the rounds in <e2>Syria</e2> during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham.
<e2>Dvmap</e2>: the first Android malware with code injection In April 2017 we started observing new rooting malware being distributed through the Google Play Store. Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries. Kaspersky Lab products detect it as <e1>Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a.</e1> The distribution of rooting malware through Google Play is not a new thing.

Such references would be in line with <e1>FrozenCell</e1>'s phishing tactics in which they used file names to lure people associated with the political party to open malicious documents. Desert Scorpion's second stage is capable of installing another non-malicious application (included in the second stage) which is highly specific to the Fatah political party and supports the targeting theory. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team is increasingly seeing the same tradecraft, tactics, and procedures that <e2>APT-C-23</e2> favors being used by other actors.

While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download <e1>RCSAndroid</e1>. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and <e2>heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871)</e2> vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.
Some versions of the <e2>Skygofree</e2> feature the self-protection ability exclusively for Huawei devices. There is a ‘protected apps’ list in this brand’s smartphones, related to a battery-saving concept. Apps not selected as protected apps stop working once the screen is off and await re-activation, so the implant is able to determine that it is running on a Huawei device and add itself to this list. Due to this feature, it is clear that the developers paid special attention to the work of the implant on Huawei devices. Also, we found a debug version of the implant (<e1>70a937b2504b3ad6c623581424c7e53d</e1>) that contains interesting constants, including the version of the spyware.
The well-developed <e1>Mandrake</e1> spyware has been continuously updated with new features, bug patches, and improved functionalities over a period of four years. The threat actors involved are using the spyware to take on individual targets. In this campaign, the spyware is used to first do a complete scan of the device and capture personal information about the targeted victim. After this, the attackers gain access to the users' preferences, device usage, inactivity times, and have the ability to record their screens. What are its capabilities? Using the spyware, the attackers could do anything from credential stealing and information exfiltration, to money transfers and blackmailing. It can also be used to surreptitiously turn the volume of the phone down and block calls or messages.

The <e1>Exodus</e1>-infected iOS apps were signed with Apple-issued enterprise certificates, which allowed victims to install the malicious apps, even from outside the App Store. Apple eventually revoked these certificates. Bauer said that compared to the Android version, which had been under development for at least five years, the iOS variant was far less sophisticated, suggesting it was a newer project. It could only collect and steal contacts, photos, videos, audio recordings, GPS information, and device location. It could also perform on-demand audio recording operations, however, it was nowhere near as intrusive and did not the same level of control of infected devices as the Android variant. The links between the two versions were also undeniable, as besides finding the iOS variant on the same server infrastructure as payloads used by the <e2>Android</e2> version, the iOS variant also uploaded stolen data to the same exiltration server, and used a similar protocol.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, <e2>Facebook</e2>, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.
The Growth of XLoader Trend Micro first observed efforts to distribute <e1>XLoader</e1> disguised as legitimate Facebook and Chrome apps in April 2018. Just months later, the security firm observed that the malware had infected 384,748 victims, with the bulk of affected users located in South Korea and Japan.

When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices. Hacking Team has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and CVE-2013-6282 in their attacks. The said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor. The shell backdoor then installs the <e2>RCSAndroid agent</e2>. This agent has two core modules, the Evidence Collector and the Event Action Trigger.

All the malicious <e1>Dvmap</e1> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For <e2>Android 4.4.4</e2> and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.

Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. <e1>Droidjack</e1> made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game <e2>Pokémon Go</e2> with the Trojan.
Trend Micro researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> (<e2>Remote Control System Android</e2>), which they says, is one of the "most professionally developed and sophisticated" pieces of Android malware a.
Cerberus and <e1>Alien</e1>: the malware that has put <e2>Android</e2> in a tight spot The most complex Android malware in recent years has released its source code and malicious actors have their own forks, strongly motivated by financial gain.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and <e2>Barclays</e2>, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.
After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, <e2>Taiwan</e2>, and Hong Kong.
Researchers believe the malware is so-called "lawful intercept" software sold to law-enforcement and governments. <e1>Exodus</e1>, as the malware for Android phones has been dubbed, was under development for at least five years. It was spread in apps disguised as service applications from <e2>Italian mobile operators</e2>. Exodus was hidden inside apps available on phishing websites and nearly 25 apps available in Google Play.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 <e1>campuphome[.]com</e1> 9 8 wewelowertick[.
Once fully installed, <e1>Exodus</e1> was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the <e2>Skype</e2> app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.
Once <e1>Gooligan</e1> has control of the phone, the victim's <e2>Google</e2> account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, <e2>Bankia</e2>, BBVA, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, Santander, and Kutxabank.
Effectively, <e1>Anubis</e1> can be considered one of the most used <e2>Android</e2> banking Trojans since late 2017.
The <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware Triout. The attack chain starts with malicious <e2>Telegram</e2> and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e2>Chrysaor</e2> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable. Content observers: use Android's ContentObserver framework to gather changes in SMS, Calendar, Contacts, Cell info, Email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Kakao, Viber, and Skype. Screenshots: captures an image of the current screen via the raw frame buffer. Keylogging: record input events by hooking IPCThreadState::Transact from /system/lib/libbinder.so, and intercepting android::parcel with the interface <e1>com.android.internal.view.IInputContext.</e1> RoomTap: silently answers a telephone call and stays connected in the background, allowing the caller to hear conversations within the range of the phone's microphone.
Once installed, <e1>Pegasus</e1> exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, <e2>Facebook</e2>, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more.
” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called <e2>Connexxa S.R.L.</e2> Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to <e1>Connexxa</e1>. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus.
The spyware has a File Manager feature allowing access to files like application data, pictures, downloads, and others, that are kept in the external storage: <e2>SpyNote</e2> has a location tracking feature based on GPS and network data. The location data is obtained by registering LocationListener using requestLocationUpdates method from LocationManager class. Moreover, a remote command can be issued to capture audio or camera feed. The code is designed to allow live footage to be obtained from all cameras available on a device with additional capabilities like zoom, flash etc. The collected data exfiltration is achieved over the command and control channel. All commands and data are sent via the normal communications channel. All traffic sent by a victim's device is compressed before being sent using java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream class: Command and control (C2, C&C) traffic is sent over an uncommonly used port <e1>tcp/215</e1>, but it is also possible for SpyNote to communicate via any other TCP port.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or <e1>Game644.res).</e1> In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights.
Despite <e1>Ginp</e1>’s expansion to Turkey, we assess the group will continue to target <e2>Spanish</e2> banking customers, as well, based on recent overlay screens our team found on the malware’s C&C server aimed at Spanish banks.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, <e2>Android Native Browser</e2>, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
Previously in 2015, we saw the Rootnik Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file /data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip which contains all the rooting exploits. If there is no such file, the malware will download it from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip. The file integrity is then inspected by comparing the MD5 value of the downloaded file and the pre-calculated one from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/md5.txt. Unzips the downloaded file to the app’s data directory and attempt to gain root privilege by systematically executing the exploits one by one. Installs busybox and remounts system partition as read-write by running a sequence of shell commands with superuser permission. The downloaded file <e1>“raw.zip”</e1> contains the exploits from “Baidu Easy Root” version 2.

According to a recent blog post from ESET, there’s a new kind of mobile malware that makes use of Twitter to control an <e2>Android</e2> device-based botnet. It’s the first known mobile malware to use this kind of social media account instead of a command-and-control server to exercise its power over infected devices. It’s called <e1>Twitoor</e1>, and this Trojan apparently lies dormant on Android devices, and awaits commands from a malicious Twitter account.
XLoader: A deep insight into the Android malware’s various campaigns <e1>XLoader</e1> was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or <e2>Chrome</e2> apps.
As anticipated, Monokle was developed by STC, the experts noticed that <e1>Monokle</e1> and the STC’s Android security suite called Defender are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure. “Command and control infrastructure that communicates with the <e2>Defender application</e2> also communicates with Monokle samples.

The malware, known as <e1>Pegasus</e1> (or <e2>Trident</e2>), was created by Israeli cyber-security firm NSO Group and has been around for at least three years --when it was first detailed in a report over the summer of 2016.
The attack campaign, named <e1>Gooligan</e1>, breached the security of over one million Google accounts. The number continues to rise at an additional 13,000 breached devices each day. Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, <e2>Google Drive</e2>, and more.
<e2>Android</e2> users warned of malware attack spreading via SMS Security researchers are warning owners of Android smartphones about a new malware attack, spreading via SMS text messages. As the team at Scandinavian security group CSIS describes, malware known as <e1>MazarBOT</e1> is being distributed via SMS in Denmark and is likely to also be encountered in other countries.
Security Without Borders said it detected nearly 25 different <e1>Exodus</e1>-infected apps that had been uploaded on the <e2>Play Store</e2> over the last two years.
Ginp Malware Not Ready to Hit the Sack Yet <e1>Ginp</e1> malware has become one of the most notorious <e2>Android</e2> banking malware family.
Hamas-linked spyware targeting Palestinians removed from Google Play store A hacking group which analysts believe is linked to Hamas successfully placed highly targeted surveillanceware in the <e2>Google Play Store</e2> in order to spy on Palestinian targets, according to new research from the mobile security firm Lookout. The newly identified malware, known as <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in Palestine.
Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. <e1>Monokle</e1> supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, <e2>WeChat</e2>, Viber, Skype, and Snapchat.
XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families <e1>XLoader</e1> and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called <e2>Yanbian Gang</e2>. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018.
However, it is possible that set of command change in future for <e1>Rotexy</e1> Trojan. Also, As per Kaspersky 98% users are targeted in Russia only rest few cases have seen in Ukraine, <e2>Turkey</e2>, Germany, and a few other countries.
” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, <e1>riveroer</e1>, and sdfkjhl2.
What we found were several other fake apps developed using the <e1>SpyNote</e1> builder, which should come as a warning to <e2>Android</e2> users.

Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The <e2>iOS</e2> variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered.
According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other <e2>Middle East</e2> countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge.
Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that <e1>Ginp</e1> malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of Turkish banks, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in Poland and the <e2>United Kingdom</e2>. Specifically, our team discovered new Ginp overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing on the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2).
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted South Korean and Japanese speakers. However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like <e2>China</e2>, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, and others.
Researchers believe that the recent <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaigns are just the beginning of a new wave of threats from <e2>Roaming Mantis</e2>, as its “authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped,” according to Almkias.
Like Ghost Push, the <e1>Gooligan</e1> malware affects pre-Android 6.0 Marshmallow devices. However, the new variant also lays bare the security risks foisted on end users by Android's dysfunctional patching system, which leaves large swathes of over one billion handsets exposed to old bugs. According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting <e2>Vroot</e2> and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively.

In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 <e2>Spanish banks</e2> including Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, Santander, and Kutxabank.
According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting <e2>Israel</e2> citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge.
In its latest form, <e1>Ginp</e1> was found with slight modifications, including a new endpoint related to downloading a module and pieces of code borrowed from <e2>Anubis</e2>. This Ginp iteration targets users of 24 apps from different Spanish banks.
Ongoing activity While monitoring this particular threat, we found another <e1>XLoader</e1> variant posing as a <e2>pornography app</e2> aimed at South Korean users.
We have provided our full, technical research in a report <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>Android</e2>:Technical Analysis and Findings of Chrysaor.
Using this, <e2>DualToy</e2> invokes APIs in iTunes’ <e1>iTunesMobileDevice.dll</e1> file via reflection, so that it can interact with iOS devices just like iTunes does.

Defending Against Cerberus Android Malware Security professionals can help their organizations defend against <e1>Cerberus</e1> <e2>Android</e2> malware and similar threats by investing in a unified endpoint management (UEM) platform for the purpose of monitoring mobile devices and tracking how they report to the network environment.
Messages are erased from the infected phone as soon as they're sent, making the malicious activity that much harder to track. <e1>RedDrop</e1>'s creators have cast a wide net. Wandera has already discovered more than 50 Android apps infected with the Trojan. Fortunately, they're all being served from third-party app stores based in <e2>China</e2>. Worryingly, Wandera says that "RedDrop is one of the most sophisticated pieces of Android malware that we have seen in broad distribution.
As seen in Figure 8, this version of <e1>Anubis</e1> is built to run on several iterations of the <e2>Android</e2> operating system, dating back to version 4.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the <e2>US government</e2> and provides a publicly funded postal service.
Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of <e2>DualToy</e2> capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example, for a 64-bit Windows PC, <e1>“AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi”</e1> and “AppleApplicationSupport64.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

<e1>Cerberus</e1> and Alien: the malware that has put <e2>Android</e2> in a tight spot The most complex Android malware in recent years has released its source code and malicious actors have their own forks, strongly motivated by financial gain.
Commands can either tell <e1>Twitoor</e1> to download and install other applications — generally of the data-stealing mobile banking malware variety — or switch to another command-and-control <e2>Twitter</e2> account.
The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Uber and more. The researchers also questioned how effective the strategy of shipping the APK malware was proving to be for its creators. “The malware required the user to OK to install, and <e2>Android</e2> pops up plenty of warnings about permissions,” researchers said.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as <e2>WeChat</e2>, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, <e2>Turkey</e2>, the UAE, and others.
Android Spyware Monokle, developed by Russian defense contractor, used in targeted attacks Researchers at Lookout discovered a new mobile spyware dubbed <e1>Monokle</e1> that was developed by a <e2>Russian defense contractor</e2>. “Lookout has discovered a highly targeted mobile malware threat that uses a new and sophisticated set of custom Android surveillanceware tools called Monokle that has possible connections to Russian threat actors.
For the purpose of this report we analyze here the <e2>Exodus</e2> One sample with hash <e1>8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884</e1> which communicated with the Command & Control server at 54.
Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group APT-C-23, also known as <e2>Two-Tailed Scorpion</e2> and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram.
Our analysis shows that <e2>SpyDealer</e2> is currently under active development. There are three versions of this malware currently in the wild, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. Starting from 1.9.3, content of configuration files and almost all constant strings in the code are encrypted or encoded. An accessibility service was also introduced in 1.9.3 to steal targeted apps’ messages. According to our dataset, most of these samples use the app name “GoogleService” or “<e1>GoogleUpdate</e1>”.
Specifically, our team discovered new <e1>Ginp</e1> overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing on the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2). These overlay pages are spoofs of legitimate banking pages, meant to deceive mobile device users into sharing confidential banking and other information. Several of these fake overlays mimic banks in <e2>Turkey</e2>, suggesting that malware operators intend to use these pages in future campaigns to target customers of Turkish banks.
<e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Trojan Spreads Via Third Party App Stores A spate of new attacks targeting the Android operating system have been discovered using a banking trojan named after a video game.
It’s interesting that we can recover its original file name which is fb_mem_root. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 also gain root privilege thought another method that doesn’t use “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drop files including sux, getroot, logo.png and busybox_g1 from assets to the app’s own data directory. Copy files sux, logo.png and busybox_g1 that are dropped in the above step to /data/data/ <package_name>/app_bin Generate shell script /data/data/<package_name>/app_bin/toor.sh with the content depicted in Figure 5. Execute png and <e1>toor.sh</e1> to gain root privilege, and these two files are deleted at the end.
ViceLeaker Android spyware targets users in the Middle East Experts at Kaspersky have uncovered a spyware campaign dubbed <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> that spreads in the <e2>Middle East</e2> to spy on Android users.

This will allow the attackers to: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Our team has identified the malicious APK to be the <e1>Mazar Android BOT</e1>, a threat also that Recorded Future spotted in November 2015. The malicious packet (APK) retrieves TOR and installs it on the victim’s phone via the following harmless URLs: https: //f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android https: //play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android In the next phase of the attack, the infection will unpack and run the TOR application, which will then be used to connect to the following server: http: // pc35hiptpcwqezgs [.] Onion. After that, an automated SMS will be sent to the number 9876543210 (+98 is the country code for Iran) with the text message: “Thank you”. The catch is that this SMS also includes the device’s location data. Insidious mobile malware with crippling options This specific mobile malware opens the doors to all kinds of malicious consequences for the victim. Attackers can: Open a backdoor into Android smartphones, to monitor and control them as they please; Send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, seriously increasing the victim’s phone bill; Read SMS messages, which means they can also read authentication codes sent as part of two-factor authentication mechanisms, used also by online banking apps and ecommerce websites; Use their full access to <e2>Android</e2> phones to basically manipulate the device to do whatever they want.
The malware, <e1>Android/SpyC32.A</e1>, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group <e2>APT-C-23</e2> (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion).
This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of <e1>Android/Twitoor.A,</e1> can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a <e2>porn player app</e2> or MMS application but without having their functionality.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise <e1>FakeSpy</e1> are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and <e2>Swiss Post</e2>. Roaming Mantis used the Android developer tool WebView to build the fake applications, which is what gives them their authenticity, Almkias said.
Who is affected? <e1>Gooligan</e1> potentially affects devices on Android 4 (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5 (Lollipop), which is over 74% of in-market devices today. About 57% of these devices are located in <e2>Asia</e2> and about 9% are in Europe.
“Lookout has discovered a highly targeted mobile malware threat that uses a new and sophisticated set of custom <e2>Android</e2> surveillanceware tools called <e1>Monokle</e1> that has possible connections to Russian threat actors.
Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate <e1>Pegasus</e1>. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the <e2>iOS</e2> version of this threat.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, <e2>Twitter</e2>, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.
Mobile <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> The following table shows meta information on the observed samples, including compiler timestamps: MD5 Package Compiler C2 51df2597faa3fce38a4c5ae024f97b1c com.xapps.SexGameForAdults dexlib 2.x 188.165.28[.]251 2d108ff3a735dea1d1fdfa430f37fab2 com.psiphon3 dexlib 2.x 188.165.49[.]205 7ed754a802f0b6a1740a99683173db73 com.psiphon3 dexlib 2.x 188.165.49[.]205 3b89e5cd49c05ce6dc681589e6c368d9 ir.abed.dastan dexlib 2.x 185.141.60[.]213 To backdoor legitimate applications, attackers used a Smali injection technique – a type of injection that allows attackers to disassemble the code of original app with the Baksmali tool, add their malicious code, and assemble it with Smali. As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 <e1>reqcalllog.php</e1> Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.
Rather than use those tokens to steal information, <e1>Gooligan</e1>-infected devices are designed to go about fraudulently earning their operators ad revenue. Check Point estimates that <e2>two million apps</e2> have been installed this way over the past three months.
But new data published today by Citizen Lab researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the <e1>Pegasus</e1> spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, <e2>France</e2>, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place.
Hacking Team used text and email messages containing specially crafted URLs that triggered exploits for several vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-2825 and CVE-2012-2871) present in the default browsers of <e2>Android 4.0 Ice Cream to 4.3 Jelly Bean</e2>, allowing the attacker to gain root privileges, and install the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> APK.
0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘<e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0’ that poses as a pornography app for Android devices. This variant abuses Instagram and <e2>Tumblr</e2> profiles to hide its C&C server.
Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous <e2>Android</e2> applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android most likely would not have been found.
Although <e1>Alien</e1> comes from a different version than the one released, it retains many of the functions that make this type of malware dangerous. First of all, it’s a very streamlined RAT with tons of features. It is also capable of running its own TeamViewer instance, and of displaying fake logins for more than 226 applications. These include not only <e2>banking apps</e2>, but social media, email, and even popular cryptocurrency wallets.
A cybersecurity research team has uncovered the “Mandrake” spying operation targeting Australian mobile banking users. <e1>Mandrake</e1> was first discovered earlier this year but is believed to be active since at least four years as a highly sophisticated spying platform. The threat actors behind the campaign have leveraged the rise in the usage of <e2>mobile banking</e2> in Australia to target individuals.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise <e1>FakeSpy</e1> are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, <e2>Japan Post</e2> and Swiss Post.
The <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to <e2>Israeli</e2> citizens.
It then downloads a malicious module from a command and control (C&C) server which allows <e1>Gooligan</e1> to steal credentials for email and other services. In addition, the control can be used to install apps from Google Play and rate them using the user’s Google account or install adware on the user’s device to generate revenue. Devices that can be affected by the malware include <e2>Android 4</e2> and Android 5, which Check Point says includes 74 percent of devices currently in use.
RCSAndroid has 4 'critical components': Penetration solutions – Methods to get into the device, either via SMS or email or a legitimate app Low-level native code – Advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android's security framework High-level Java agent – The application's malicious APK Command-and-control (C&C) servers – Servers used to remotely send or receive malicious commands Given that the source code of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> is now available to everybody, it will likely put <e2>Android</e2> users in danger.

Researchers note that XLoader has been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called the Yanbian Gang. <e1>XLoader</e1> is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected <e2>Android</e2> apps.
It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). <e1>APT-C-23</e1> is known to utilize both Windows and <e2>Android</e2> components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones.
We named the malware <e1>Skygofree</e1>, because we found the word in one of the domains*. Malware Features Android According to the observed samples and their signatures, early versions of this <e2>Android</e2> malware were developed by the end of 2014 and the campaign has remained active ever since.
" While <e1>Monokle</e1> currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, <e2>Azerbaijan</e2>, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria.
“This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The <e2>HackingTeam</e2>’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said.
In the latest activity identified by Volexity, the <e1>Evil Eye</e1> threat actor used an open source framework called IRONSQUIRREL to launch their exploit chain. The exploits used targeted Apple iOS operating systems leveraging a vulnerability in <e2>WebKit</e2> that appears to have been patched in the summer of 2019.
<e1>Ginp</e1> Android trojan targets <e2>banking apps</e2> & threatens 2FA/SMS Dubbed Ginp; the trojan keeps coming back with new capabilities.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, <e2>Kakao</e2> Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise <e1>FakeSpy</e1> are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, <e2>France’s La Poste</e2>, Japan Post and Swiss Post.
This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives. During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Trojan evolved from an SMS spyware Trojan that was first spotted in October 2014. Back then it was detected as <e1>Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief,</e1> but later versions were assigned to another family – Trojan-Banker.
<e2>Russia</e2> Got Targeted By <e1>Rotexy</e1> Trojan Due to the hipe of trojan activity, Kaspersky decided to do a deep analysis of the evolution of popular malware family.
TangleBot employs more or less similar tactics as the recently-announced notorious <e1>FlutBot</e1> SMS <e2>Android</e2> malware that targets mobile devices.

A TrickMo Kill Switch One of the most interesting features of the <e2>TrickMo</e2> malware is having its own kill switch. Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo’s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the “4” key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You’re Infected? The following SMS message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key: HrLbpr3x/htAVnAgYepBuH2xmFDb68TYTt7FwGn0ddGlQJv/hqsctL57ocFU0Oz3L+uhLcOGG7GVBAfHKL1TBQ== Sending this SMS will trigger TrickMo’s kill switch by sending the string “4” encrypted with the generated RSA public key and base64 encoded.

ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from <e1>Anubis</e1>, an <e2>Android</e2> malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. <e2>USPS</e2> is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service.
So far, <e1>DualToy</e1> mainly targets <e2>Chinese</e2> users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland.
How it’s different from the iOS version The biggest distinction between the <e2>iOS</e2> and Android versions of <e1>Pegasus</e1> is the Android version does not use zero-day vulnerabilities to root the device.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

, has actively targeted institutions globally, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, <e2>Poland</e2>, Spain, Turkey, the UK & the US. Researchers think <e1>Alien</e1> is a “fork” of the infamous Cerberus banking malware, which has had a steady reduction in use over the last year.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or <e1>Game644.res.</e1> It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched.
<e1>Exodus</e1>: New <e2>Android</e2> Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named Exodus, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two.
STEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION <e2>FakeSpy</e2> has multiple built in information stealing capabilities. The first function is used for contact information stealing: the function upCon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information. Then, it sends it to the C2 server using the URL that ends with /servlet/ContactUpload. The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number and contact’s phone number Contacts - A headline used for the attacker to distinguish between the type of stolen information he gets Name - Contact’s full name (Display name) For testing purposes we inserted a fake contacts list to our Android Emulator and observed resultant behavior. The second stealing function is the onStartCommand, which steals infected device data and additional information. The stolen data is sent to the C2 server using the URL ending with <e1>/servlet/xx</e1>. The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number Machine - The device model (in our example: Google Pixel 2) Sversion - The OS version Bank - Checks if there are any banking-related or cryptocurrency trading apps Provider - The telecommunication provider (IMSI value in device settings) npki - Checks if the folder named NPKI (National Public Key Infrastructure) might contain authentication certificates related to financial transactions FakeSpy asks to be the default SMS app because it uses the function onReceive to intercept incoming SMS messages.
It Starts With Social Engineering One of the recent features added to <e1>Ginp</e1> is the ability to make it appear as if a legitimate SMS message is being received on a device. The server sends a command called “INSERT_SMS,” which triggers the malware to effectively mimic the process of receiving a new SMS message. The messages reference documents that need to be signed or suspicious activity on a banking account—among other ploys—in an attempt to invoke a sense of urgency and persuade the victim to open his or her mobile banking application. An additional technique the malware uses is generating fake push notifications. The server can send a “PUSH_NOTIFY” command to generate a fake “push” notification and make it appear as if it’s coming from the banking app. Activate the Overlay In general, as soon as the victim uses his or her <e2>banking app</e2>, this activity is logged and sent to the C&C server.
Here are some of the features of <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, <e2>Twitter</e2>, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger.
First <e2>Twitter</e2>‑controlled Android botnet discovered Detected by ESET as <e1>Android/Twitoor</e1>, this malware is unique because of its resilience mechanism.
“Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of <e1>Monokle</e1>: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the <e2>Central Asian</e2> nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.
XLoader distributed via DNS domains <e1>XLoader</e1> was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or <e2>Chrome</e2> apps.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in <e2>Tokyo</e2>. Chunghwa Post - The government-owned corporation Chunghwa is the official postal service of Taiwan.
Polipo proxy and Man-in-the-Middle Attack The attackers behind <e1>Mazar BOT</e1> also implemented the “Polipo proxy“, which gives them additional access to even more Android functionalities. An even higher degree of compromise: <e2>Chrome</e2> injects As if it weren’t enough that it can stop calls and launch other aggressive commands on the victim’s phone, Mazar BOT is also capable of injecting itself into Chrome.
Like Ghost Push, the <e1>Gooligan</e1> malware affects pre-Android 6.0 Marshmallow devices. However, the new variant also lays bare the security risks foisted on end users by Android's dysfunctional patching system, which leaves large swathes of over one billion handsets exposed to old bugs. According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and <e2>Towelroot</e2>, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Also, the C&C infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families. “The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like Pegasus or FinFisher,” the researchers pointed out.
"I would hope that [users] would remember the Adobe Flash prompt but after that they probably won't see very much from <e1>TangleBot</e1>," Kalember said. "Like most pieces of mobile malware, it is relatively stealthy in terms of its appearance." Once the malware is installed on the device, "it is pretty hard to remove it," according to Kalember and the stolen information can be monetized well into the future. Hackers who steal identifying information in this manner often sell it online, rather than using it directly themselves. Cloudmark analysts note "there is a growing market for detailed personal and account data" on the dark web. "The infected Android devices can be monetized in lots of different ways," Kalember said. "Even if they don't do banking fraud right away, there might be lots of other ways to monetize those stolen credentials," he added. Kalember added that if an <e2>Android</e2> user discovers the TangleBot malware and is somehow able to remove it, the attackers can still simply hold onto the stolen information without acting on it immediately, lulling victims into believing their information was not hacked.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware.

400 Banks’ Customers Targeted with <e1>Anubis</e1> Trojan The new campaign masqueraded as an <e2>Orange Telecom</e2> account management app to deliver the latest iteration of Anubis banking malware.
<e1>ViceLeaker</e1> Operation: mobile espionage targeting Middle East In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (<e2>Android</e2> application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection.
Considering the increasing demand for <e2>Android</e2> banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of <e1>Anubis</e1> are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events.
This makes <e1>Dvmap</e1> the first Android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime, and it has been downloaded from the <e2>Google Play Store</e2> more than 50,000 times.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 campuphome[.]com 9 8 wewelowertick[.]com 3 9 <e1>bigslogous[.]com</e1> 25 10 zavannerweb[.

Geography of Rotexy attacks According to our data, 98% of all <e2>Rotexy</e2> attacks target users in Russia. Indeed, the Trojan explicitly targets Russian-speaking users. There have also been cases of users in Ukraine, Germany, Turkey and several other countries being affected. Kaspersky Internet Security for Android and the Sberbank Online app securely protect users against attacks by this Trojan.

This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the <e2>Android</e2> releases offered.
Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used Pegasus to illegally spy on <e2>journalists</e2>, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes.
Trend Micro mobile threat analyst Tony Bao discovered a variant of <e2>Anubis</e2> (detected by Trend Micro as <e1>AndroidOS_AnubisDropper</e1>) of the same type a few months ago.
RCSANDROID has the ability to: Collect Passwords for both networks (your WiFi) and accounts (your bank) Collect your location Record you calls or what is being said around your device Collect you contact information Collect you email and texts And a lot more. <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> was known about as far back as 2012. It uses two known vulnerabilities in the default Android Internet browser found in Android versions 4.0 to 4.3 (<e2>CVE-2012-2825</e2> and CVE-2012-2871).
We found that among the leaked files is the code for Hacking Team’s open-source malware suite <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> (<e2>Remote Control System Android</e2>), which was sold by the company as a tool for monitoring targets.

" Cerberus is not seen as "moving the needle" for trojan capabilities, but it's dangerous nonetheless. "<e1>Cerberus</e1> should not be taken lightly," ThreatFabric warns. It can harvest contacts, send messages, steal credentials. And its overlays are not limited to banking apps—it can attack messaging or other accounts using the same techniques. The rental model is interesting—it ensures the malware can evolve and spread quickly, and it increases the likely damage during its lifespan. There is also the question of the apps coverage thus far—<e2>U.S.</e2>, France and Japan.

Coronavirus Update App Leads to Project Spy Android and iOS Spyware We discovered a potential cyberespionage campaign, which we have named <e2>Project Spy</e2>, that infects Android and iOS devices with spyware (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_ProjectSpy.HRX and <e1>IOS_ProjectSpy.A,</e1> respectively).
Researchers note that <e1>XLoader</e1> has been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called the <e2>Yanbian</e2> Gang.
Examples of modern families based on <e2>Marcher</e2> are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot <e1>Bubabot</e1> Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.
<e1>DualToy</e1>: New Windows Trojan Sideloads Risky Apps to <e2>Android</e2> and iOS Devices Over the past two years, we’ve observed many cases of Microsoft Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, <e2>Chase</e2>, SunTrust, and Wells Fargo.
The use of a specific certificate and SSL verification means that the malware will not talk to just any listening HTTPS server, which adds complexity to analyzing <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> in a sandbox environment. To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to "trick" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the <e2>Signal</e2> app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted.
The spyware, called Pegasus and developed by the Israeli company NSO Group, is reportedly instrumental to several governments’ oppressive surveillance campaigns against their own citizens and residents, and, while <e2>NSO Group</e2> has repeatedly denied allegations that it complicitly sells <e1>Pegasus</e1> to human right abusers, it is difficult to reconcile exactly how the zero-click spyware program—which non-consensually and invisibly steals emails, text messages, photos, videos, locations, passwords, and social media activity—is at the same time a tool that can, in its very use, respect the rights of those around the world to speak freely, associate safely, and live privately.
One of the new <e1>HummingWhale</e1> apps came to the attention of Check Point after it noticed a familiar piece of code that appeared in not one, but a dozen different apps, which indicated that malware was installed within them. Can install infinite number of malware apps All of the apps found were uploaded using the names of fake Chinese developers. In addition to these apps, 16 distinct package names related to the same malware were found on the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>. The most alarming element of the app was a 1.

However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file <e1>data.db</e1> using a pseudo-random algorithm.
Previously in 2015, we saw the Rootnik Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file /data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip which contains all the rooting exploits. If there is no such file, the malware will download it from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip. The file integrity is then inspected by comparing the MD5 value of the downloaded file and the pre-calculated one from <e1>http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/md5.txt.</e1> Unzips the downloaded file to the app’s data directory and attempt to gain root privilege by systematically executing the exploits one by one.
As part of our investigation into this malware, we emulated an infected Android device in order to communicate with the <e1>RuMMS</e1> C2 server. During one session, the C2 server commanded our emulated device to send four different SMS messages to four different phone numbers, all of which were associated with <e2>Russian</e2> financial institutions.

However, some users, especially those who want to install Android apps from a PC or Mac, or who want to do advanced operations with their Android devices, This is because ADB is both the only official interface for a Windows or Mac computer to operate an Android device via USB and it is a debugging interface. Install ADB drivers Once loaded, the module will first download universal Windows ADB drivers from its C2 server (e.g., from http[:]//www.zaccl.com/tool/new_tool.zip) and install them. Then, some variants will directly drop a file named adb.exe which is the standard ADB Windows client. Other variants have compiled the ADB client’s source code into the module so that they could also perform ADB operations. Instead of adb.exe, the newest variant will drop <e1>tadb.exe,</e1> a customized ADB client from Tencent’s Android management software.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e2>Chrysaor</e2> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets <e1>Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE</e1> to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. <e1>Port 6205</e1>: Gmail extraction service.

“As is common with banking malware, <e1>Cerberus</e1> disguised itself as a genuine app in order to access the banking details of unsuspecting users,” Ondrej David, with Avast, said in a Tuesday analysis. “What’s not so common is that a banking trojan managed to sneak onto the Google Play Store.” To avoid initial detection, the app hid its malicious intentions for the first few weeks while being available on Google Play. During this time, the app acted normally as a legitimate <e2>converter</e2>, and it not steal any data or cause any harm, David said.

Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner. All have now been removed from Google Play, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that <e2>Facebook</e2> and YouTube pages advertising some of them were still up.
Instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server, it receives instructions via tweets. <e1>Android/Twitoor</e1> is a backdoor capable of downloading other malware onto an infected device. It has been active for around one month. This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of <e2>Android/Twitoor.A,</e2> can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs.
” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, <e1>cacama18</e1>, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.
They weren’t able to determine the identity of Center-1 and <e1>Center-2</e1>, though both appear to target mainly in the <e2>Middle East</e2>. The firm said that it believes that NSO Group is constantly working to develop new vectors of infection.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 <e1>glowbobget[.]com</e1> 45 4 hellowopung[.
As anticipated, Monokle was developed by STC, the experts noticed that <e1>Monokle</e1> and the STC’s Android security suite called <e2>Defender</e2> are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure.
After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, <e2>Taiwan</e2>, and Hong Kong.
The Growth of XLoader Trend Micro first observed efforts to distribute <e1>XLoader</e1> disguised as legitimate <e2>Facebook</e2> and Chrome apps in April 2018.
Exodus: New Android Spyware Made in Italy Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named <e1>Exodus</e1>, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two. We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victims are located in <e2>Italy</e2>. All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google.
All the malicious <e1>Dvmap</e1> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module “ip” This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off “VerifyApps” and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the “initial phase”, the Trojan will install the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app. Its main purpose is to download archives and execute the “start” binary from them. During the investigation, this app was able to successfully connect to the command and control server, but it received no commands. So I don’t know what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files. Conclusions This Trojan was distributed through the <e2>Google Play Store</e2> and uses a number of very dangerous techniques, including patching system libraries.
" Users of <e2>Android 5.0 Lollipop</e2> may also be in danger of being targeted, as some emails sent among Hacking Team executives indicates that "<e1>Hacking Team</e1> was in the process of developing exploits for Android 5.

Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

The legitimate version of this app is also available on <e2>Google Play</e2>. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.
Dropping Cluster Bombs <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect <e2>Android</e2> devices.
<e1>Dvmap</e1>: the first <e2>Android</e2> malware with code injection In April 2017 we started observing new rooting malware being distributed through the Google Play Store.
The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone. <e1>Pegasus</e1> is designed to infiltrate devices running Android, <e2>Blackberry</e2>, iOS and Symbian operating systems and turn them into surveillance devices.
During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “<e2>Conversations</e2>.” The tainted version used by the <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app.
The attack campaign, named <e1>Gooligan</e1>, breached the security of over one million Google accounts. The number continues to rise at an additional 13,000 breached devices each day. Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, <e2>Google Docs</e2>, G Suite, Google Drive, and more.

According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, <e2>Capital One</e2>, Chase, SunTrust, and Wells Fargo.
In its analysis, CSIS notes that <e1>MazarBOT</e1> was reported by Recorded Future last November as being actively sold in Russian underground forums and intriguingly, the malware will not activate on Android devices configured with Russian language settings. This, in itself, does not prove that the perpetrators of the malware campaign are based in Russia, but it certainly sounds as if that is a strong possibility. Malware authors in the past have often coded a “safety net” into their malware to prevent them from accidentally infecting their own computers and devices. For more detailed information about the threat, check out the blog post from CSIS. And, of course, remember to always be wary of unsolicited, unusual text messages and installing apps from third-party sources on your <e2>Android</e2> smartphone.

Check Point saw Android phones infected with malicious software containing early <e1>Gooligan</e1> code when physically connected to PCs running a Windows back-up tool, <e2>SnapPea</e2>. Whilst the attackers used multiple exploits and forced downloads on users' devices in last year's attacks, they hadn't pilfered Google account logins.
Later the malware using local SQLite database, to store the data that harvested from infected mobile and an information about C&C servers. “<e2>Rotexy</e2> intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C. Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers.

Previously, it's been assumed <e1>APT-C-23</e1> is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party <e2>Fatah</e2>. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps.
Once installed, <e1>Pegasus</e1> exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, <e2>Skype</e2>, WhatsApp, WeChat and more.
For example, we found a piece of a particularly sophisticated <e2>Android</e2> ransomware with novel techniques and behavior, exemplifying the rapid evolution of mobile threats that we have also observed on other platforms. The mobile ransomware, detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as <e1>AndroidOS/MalLocker.B</e1>, is the latest variant of a ransomware family that’s been in the wild for a while but has been evolving non-stop.
In addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, <e1>DualToy</e1> also performs the following activities on <e2>Android</e2> and iOS devices: Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like AceDeceiver) Several years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to pair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy.
The <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware Triout. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults.” Attackers aim to backdoor legitimate applications with an unusual injection technique dubbed Smali. The mobile malware also aims to inject legitimate mobile applications with a backdoor for persistent access once it has compromised an Android device. “To backdoor legitimate applications, attackers used a Smali injection technique – a type of injection that allows attackers to disassemble the code of original app with the Baksmali tool, add their malicious code, and assemble it with Smali.” reads the analysis published by Kaspersky. “As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to <e1>dexlib</e1>, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files.

The second <e1>Project Spy</e1> version has similar capabilities to the first version, with the addition of the following: Stealing notification messages sent from <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Facebook, and Telegram Abandoning the FTP mode of uploading the recorded images Aside from changing the app’s supposed function and look, the second and third versions’ codes had little differences.
This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes. All the detections of this backdoored app were geolocated in Iran. Backdoored Conversations C2 server analysis During the analysis of the Smali injected apps and their C2 server infrastructure we hadn’t found any interesting clues, but things changed when we looked at the C2 server of the linked Conversations messenger. It uses “185.51.201[.]133” as a main C2 address, and there is only one domain that is hosted on this dedicated server – <e1>iliageram[.]ir.</e1> Note that we later found versions that used the domain as a C2 directly instead of the IP address.

If a visiting device passes the first checks put in place by Evil Eye, code similar to the following would be returned: The file jquery.js contains the main logic and the server's public key, while the file s.js contains the supporting Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library used to generate a client key pair. This client public key is passed as a variable into the loading of the final JavaScript. If each step of the JavaScript above is successful, it results in a Mach-O binary running on the phone. This application contains an iOS exploit for the targeted version and another Mach-O binary, the <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> implant, embedded in it.
After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of <e1>Pegasus</e1> was running on phones in <e2>Israel</e2>, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others.

Hacking Team’s <e1>RCS Android</e1>: The most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed “As each day passes and researchers find more and more source code in the huge Hacking Team data dump, it becomes more clear what the company’s customers could do with the spyware, and what capabilities other organized and commercial malware authors will soon be equipping their malicious wares with. After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on <e2>Google Play</e2>), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: RCS Android (Remote Control System Android).
This variant is distributed via smishing. <e1>XLoader</e1> version 6.0 abuses <e2>Twitter</e2> profiles to hide its C&C server.
Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and <e2>Telegram</e2>. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store.
This APK contained the variant of <e1>XLoader</e1>, a family of malware that is capable of behaving as spyware and a banking Trojan. In the event an <e2>iOS</e2> user visited one of the malicious websites, the campaign redirected to another website that prompted them to download a malicious iOS configuration profile.
) After reinstallation, the core <e2>SpyDealer</e2> service (<e1>AaTService</e1>) is launched to perform malicious behaviors.
In a recent malware operation, the <e1>Anubis</e1> Android banking malware is targeting clients of approximately 400 banking institutions. The cybercriminals are attacking <e2>financial institutions</e2>, cryptocurrency wallets, and digital payment systems by posing as an Orange S.
In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> was spotted in a Google Play Store app called <e2>Dardesh</e2>. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3.
Recent samples of <e1>Monokle</e1> include the Xposed framework that allows <e2>Android</e2> users to apply modules to an Android device’s ROM(Read Only Memory).
The Dardesh app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious <e2>Dardesh</e2> chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play.
Security researchers have discovered over 17,000 new <e1>Anubis</e1> samples targeting over 377 banking applications spread in 93 countries, including the <e2>United States</e2>, Europe, and India.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

STEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION <e2>FakeSpy</e2> has multiple built in information stealing capabilities. The first function is used for contact information stealing: the function upCon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information. Then, it sends it to the C2 server using the URL that ends with <e1>/servlet/ContactUpload</e1>. The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number and contact’s phone number Contacts - A headline used for the attacker to distinguish between the type of stolen information he gets Name - Contact’s full name (Display name) For testing purposes we inserted a fake contacts list to our Android Emulator and observed resultant behavior.

For simplicity, we’ll reference this as <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the <e2>iOS</e2> threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications.
Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate <e1>Pegasus</e1>. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target <e2>Mexican activists</e2>, according to The New York Times.

New XLoader Variant Masquerades as Android Security Apps, iOS Configuration Profile A new variant of <e1>XLoader</e1> is masquerading as Android security apps and an <e2>iOS configuration profile</e2> to target mobile users.
Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that <e1>TrickMo</e1>’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by <e2>German banks</e2>. In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a “kill switch” that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device.
According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the U.S. reported the second largest attacks (17.17%) and <e2>Hong Kong</e2> stood third (4.

You can see the app’s Play Store page below: <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the <e2>Fatah</e2> political party.
The Android app, called “<e1>TrickMo</e1>” by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted <e2>German</e2> (in September 2019) users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise <e1>FakeSpy</e1> are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the <e2>British Royal Mail</e2>, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and Swiss Post.

It’s interesting that <e2>Triout</e2>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from Israel. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample. A subsequent investigation revealed that the spyware has the following capabilities: Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php) Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php) Has capability to hide self Can send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.php) Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C (uppc.php, <e1>fi npic.php</e1> orreqpic.
Mazar BOT won’t run on Russian Android smartphones Our team was not surprised to observe that the malware cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with the Russian language option. <e2>Mazar BOT</e2> will check the phone to identify the victim’s country and this will stop the malicious APK if the targeted phone turns out to be owned by a Russian user: locale.getCountry () equalsIgnoreCase ( “RU”)) <e1>Process.killProcess (Process.myPid ());</e1> Until now, Mazar BOT has been advertised for sale on several websites on the Dark Web, but this is the first time we’ve seen this code be abused in active attacks.
Conclusion The operation of <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> is still ongoing, as is our research. The attackers have taken down their communication channels and are probably looking for ways to assemble their tools in a different manner. Kaspersky detects and blocks samples of the ViceLeaker operation using the following verdict: Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.ViceLeaker.* Actually, we are currently investigating whether this group might also be behind a large-scale web-oriented attack at the end of 2018 using code injection and exploiting SQL vulnerabilities. Even when this would not be directly related to the <e2>Android</e2> malware described in this blogpost, it would be an indicator of wider capabilities and objectives of this actor.
In this blog, we showed that the threat actor behind the recent <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaign is a Chinese-speaking group called “Roaming Mantis” known to operate mainly in Asia. It is interesting to see that the group has expanded their operation to other regions, such as the United States and <e2>Europe</e2>. The malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped.

400 Banks’ Customers Targeted with Anubis Trojan The new campaign masqueraded as an Orange Telecom account management app to deliver the latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> banking malware. Customers of Chase, Wells Fargo, <e2>Bank of America</e2> and Capital One, along with nearly 400 other financial institutions, are being targeted by a malicious app disguised to look like the official account management platform for French telecom company Orange S.
The variant we are analyzing shows some similar traits, with a few modifications, to malware named <e2>RuMMS</e2>, which was initially reported by FireEye researchers back in 2016. This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.
“Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of <e1>Monokle</e1>: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic <e2>Uzbekistan.”</e2> In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild.
Although it is hard to say why <e2>maza-in</e2> really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated <e1>Anubis</e1> samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active.

Once fully installed, <e1>Exodus</e1> was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the <e2>Facebook</e2> app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.
Defending Against <e1>Cerberus</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Malware Security professionals can help their organizations defend against Cerberus Android malware and similar threats by investing in a unified endpoint management (UEM) platform for the purpose of monitoring mobile devices and tracking how they report to the network environment.
A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone <e1>Ursnif</e1> is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in <e2>Italy</e2>, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence.
Anubis samples Some of the latest <e1>Anubis</e1> samples found in the wild: Build date: Mar 19 2019 App name: <e2>FlashPlayer</e2> Package name: com.
According to researchers, <e1>Cerberus</e1> already contains overlay attack templates for a total of 30 unique targets, including: 7 <e2>French banking</e2> apps 7 U.
TCP Server <e2>SpyDealer</e2> creates a TCP server on the compromised device listening at <e1>port 39568</e1> and waits for incoming commands.
Such functionality granted full access over an infected device to <e1>Cerberus</e1>’ handlers. As such, they could leverage that functionality to change the device’s settings, install or remove any app, use an app, and conduct espionage on the device’s activity. Not only that, but the threat actors could use a simple overlay in Cerberus requiring its victims to unlock their device. The overlay analyzed by researchers stole victims’ screen lock codes/credentials, allowing the threat actors to remotely unlock a device for the purpose of performing fraud. Attackers could also abuse the Accessibility features to steal 2FA codes from the <e2>Google Authentication app</e2> for the purpose of bypassing authentication services.
The newest <e1>Anubis</e1> acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the <e2>fake Orange app</e2> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts.
Since then a newly discovered variant of the <e1>Cerberus</e1> <e2>Android</e2> trojan has been spotted, with vastly expanded and more sophisticated info-harvesting capabilities, and the ability to run TeamViewer.
The interesting thing is this Android (<e1>Rotexy</e1>) Trojan malware is targeting mostly Russians, in the last 3 months over 70K users primarily located in <e2>Russia</e2> has been targeted.

Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “<e2>DigitalApps</e2>” store.
Whenever an <e2>Android</e2> user visited a malicious site and/or pressed any of the available buttons, the campaign triggered the download of an Android Package (APK) for fake security software (assuming the user has enabled the installation of third-party apps in their Unknown Sources settings). This APK contained the variant of <e1>XLoader</e1>, a family of malware that is capable of behaving as spyware and a banking Trojan.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices.

The well-developed <e1>Mandrake</e1> spyware has been continuously updated with new features, bug patches, and improved functionalities over a period of four years. The threat actors involved are using the spyware to take on individual targets. In this campaign, the spyware is used to first do a complete scan of the device and capture personal information about the targeted victim. After this, the attackers gain access to the users' preferences, device usage, inactivity times, and have the ability to record their screens. What are its capabilities? Using the spyware, the attackers could do anything from credential stealing and information exfiltration, to money transfers and blackmailing. It can also be used to surreptitiously turn the volume of the phone down and block calls or messages. The researchers noted that the attackers might also be running an affiliate program to sell the victims' information or access to others. Who is targeted? The first attack wave from the threat actors was observed in 2016-2017 which was directed at targets in the UK, US, <e2>Germany</e2>, and the Netherlands.
The malicious apps are all developed by a Korean company named <e1>Kiniwini</e1>, registered on Google Play as <e2>ENISTUDIO corp</e2>. The company develops mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms.
Steal iOS device information After successfully connecting with an <e2>iOS</e2> device, <e1>DualToy</e1> will collect device and system information, encrypt them and send to its C2 server.
A cybersecurity research team has uncovered the “<e1>Mandrake</e1>” spying operation targeting Australian <e2>mobile banking</e2> users.
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. <e1>SpyDealer</e1> has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and <e2>Baidu Net Disk</e2> Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: <e2>Trend Micro</e2> Dr.
This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives. During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Trojan evolved from an SMS spyware Trojan that was first spotted in October 2014. Back then it was detected as Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but later versions were assigned to another family – <e1>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy.</e1> The modern version of Rotexy combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware.
A Windows Trojan called <e1>DualToy</e1> has been discovered that can side load malicious apps onto <e2>Android</e2> and iOS devices via a USB connection from an infected computer.
According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising <e1>Pegasus</e1> as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, <e2>Facebook Messenger</e2>, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history.
” New <e2>Anubis</e2> Tricks Once downloaded on the device, the banking trojan makes a connection with the command-and-control (C2) server and downloads another application to initiate the SOCKS5 proxy. “This proxy allows the attacker to enforce authentication for clients communicating with their server and mask communications between the client and C2. Once retrieved and decrypted, the APK is saved as ‘FR.apk’ in ‘/data/data/fr.orange.serviceapp/app_apk,'” the researchers wrote. A scam message then pops up asking the user to disable Google Play Protect, giving the attacker full control, the report said. The analysts found more than 394 unique apps targeted by <e1>fr.orange.serviceapp,</e1> including banks, reloadable card companies and cryptocurrency wallets.
Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that <e2>Cerberus</e2> was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of <e1>Cerberus (v2)</e1> was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app.
Examples of modern families based on <e2>Marcher</e2> are: ExoBot Gustuff <e1>DiseaseBot</e1> Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.
What it does The surveillance functionality of <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The <e2>chat application</e2> acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app.

Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the U.S, U.K, Australia, <e2>Canada</e2>, Germany, France, India and Italy, according to researchers.
New <e1>TangleBot</e1> malware is targeting <e2>Android</e2> devices in the US and Canada A cyber security company, Proofpoint/Cloudmark has recently identified a new threat that can take over the victim’s mobile phone through SMS.
Such overlays are designed around specific apps, and <e1>Cerberus</e1> has developed more than 30 of these thus far. Of note, the target banks are in the U.S., France and <e2>Japan</e2>—a fairly specific list of countries.
Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of <e1>FakeSpy</e1> target not only <e2>Korean</e2> and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world.
Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, <e1>Mandrake</e1> won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. For unknown reasons, it also avoids installing itself on phones with Verizon SIM cards, or SIM cards from a top Chinese cellular carrier. Its primary target appears to be Australia, followed by North America, western Europe (and Poland) and some of the richer parts of <e2>South America</e2>.
RCSANDROID has the ability to: Collect Passwords for both networks (your WiFi) and accounts (your bank) Collect your location Record you calls or what is being said around your device Collect you contact information Collect you email and texts And a lot more. <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> was known about as far back as 2012. It uses two known vulnerabilities in the default Android Internet browser found in Android versions 4.0 to 4.3 (CVE-2012-2825 and CVE-2012-2871). There was also fake app on Google Play that helped compromise a system. According to emails leaked in the <e2>Hacking Team</e2> data dump work for a fifth version of the software and it is not clear if this was the code that was released.
In Anubis' case, this also includes Android emulators such as Genymotion. <e1>Anubis</e1> is not the only <e2>Android</e2> malware variant which is being constantly improved and refined by its developers.

The class “org.starsizew.Ac” is designed for this purpose; its only task is to check if the main service is running, and restart the main service if the answer is no. The class “org.starsizew.Tb” also has a self-monitoring mechanism to restart itself when its own onDestroy API is triggered. Other than that, its major functionality is to collect private device information, upload it to a remote C2 server, and handle any commands as requested by the C2 server. All those functions are implemented in asynchronous tasks by “org.starsizew.i”. The class “org.starsizew.Ma” is registered to intercept incoming SMS messages, the arrival of which will trigger the Android system to call its “onReceive” API. Its major functionality is also implemented through the call of the asynchronous task (“org.starsizew.i”), including uploading the incoming SMS messages to the remote C2 server and executing any commands as instructed by the remote attacker. C2 Communication The C2 communication includes two parts: sending information to the remote HTTP server and parsing the server’s response to execute any commands as instructed by the remote attackers.

New malware seizes on COVID-19 to target Android users A new form of malware that experts are referring to as "<e1>TangleBot</e1>" is relying on interest in COVID-19 to trick <e2>Android</e2> users in the U.
The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number Machine - The device model (in our example: Google Pixel 2) Sversion - The OS version Bank - Checks if there are any banking-related or cryptocurrency trading apps Provider - The telecommunication provider (IMSI value in device settings) npki - Checks if the folder named NPKI (National Public Key Infrastructure) might contain authentication certificates related to financial transactions <e2>FakeSpy</e2> asks to be the default SMS app because it uses the function onReceive to intercept incoming SMS messages. It saves the messages’ metadata and content, filters the information by fields, and sends them to the C2 server using the URL <e1>/servlet/SendMassage2</e1>. The fields it collects are: Mobile - The phone number which sent the SMS Content - The message body Sender - The contact name who sent the message Time - The time the message was received The malware uses the function sendAll to send messages that spread the malware to other devices.
It evolved from an SMS based spyware that was active in 2014. <e2>Rotexy</e2> malware evaluation was at a peak in 2014 & 2015 and it mainly using the phishing links in order to compromise the users that prompt to install the malicious apps. It uses the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service, malicious C&C server, and incoming SMS messages to reach the victim’s devices. The main function of this mobile malware is the banking Trojan and ransomware which is distributed in name of <e1>AvitoPay.apk.</e1> It using the various download from various malicious websites including youla9d6h.
Citizen Lab didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of <e1>Pegasus</e1>’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving <e2>iMessage</e2> or FaceTime messages or notifications.
What’s going on? <e1>Ginp</e1> malware was first discovered in 2019 and started as an SMS stealer. However, it soon upgraded itself to being one of the most advanced financial fraud landscape actors. Its target set consists mostly of customers of Spanish banks; nevertheless, the operators are planning on evolving their strategies to propagate in Turkey. Know the history The initial version of the malware masqueraded as a Google Play Verificator app. In August 2019, a new variant was launched with banking-specific capabilities, disguised as fake Adobe Flash Player apps. The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with Viber and <e2>Snapchat</e2>. By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the Anubis trojan source code.
Because all the URLs used in this campaign have the form of <e1>hxxp://yyyyyyyy[.]XXXX.ru/mms.apk</e1> (where XXXX.ru represents the hosting provider’s domain), we named this malware family <e2>RuMMS</e2>. To lure the victims to download the malware, threat actors use SMS phishing – sending a short SMS message containing a malicious URL to the potential victims.
The well-developed <e1>Mandrake</e1> spyware has been continuously updated with new features, bug patches, and improved functionalities over a period of four years. The threat actors involved are using the spyware to take on individual targets. In this campaign, the spyware is used to first do a complete scan of the device and capture personal information about the targeted victim. After this, the attackers gain access to the users' preferences, device usage, inactivity times, and have the ability to record their screens. What are its capabilities? Using the spyware, the attackers could do anything from credential stealing and information exfiltration, to money transfers and blackmailing. It can also be used to surreptitiously turn the volume of the phone down and block calls or messages. The researchers noted that the attackers might also be running an affiliate program to sell the victims' information or access to others. Who is targeted? The first attack wave from the threat actors was observed in 2016-2017 which was directed at targets in the UK, US, Germany, and the <e2>Netherlands</e2>. The current wave of attacks from 2018-2020 is more focused on Australian users, with little presence in the US, Canada, and Europe.

And <e1>Gooligan</e1> is spreading at an alarming rate: since the start of this month, it's been racking up an average of 13,000 new infections every day, according to researchers from Check Point. The malicious software first gains a foothold on devices when users visit a website and download a third-party app. Michael Shaulov, head of mobile and cloud Security Check Point, said that might be a porn site, or a <e2>third-party app store</e2>, where visitors are encouraged to download software to get access to content.

<e1>RuMMS</e1>: The Latest Family of Android Malware Attacking Users in <e2>Russia</e2> Via SMS Phishing Introduction Recently we observed an Android malware family being used to attack users in Russia.
However, there is also an English version of the <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> app (see Figure 3) besides the Portuguese one, and that app has neither geographical nor language restrictions. Playing further off the suggested GAS Tecnologia link, the app promises better security for its users. The description in <e2>Portuguese</e2> promises more protection for the user’s applications, including end-to-end encryption.
“Command and control infrastructure that communicates with the Defender application also communicates with <e1>Monokle</e1> samples. The signing certificates used for signing <e2>Android</e2> application packages overlap between Defender and Monokle as well.
FireEye experts noted: “So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider).” “The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and <e1>sdfkjhl2</e1>.) The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, <e2>Santander</e2>, and Kutxabank.
<e1>Anubis</e1> now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, <e2>Germany</e2>, Australia, and Poland.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

As anticipated, <e1>Monokle</e1> was developed by <e2>STC</e2>, the experts noticed that Monokle and the STC’s Android security suite called Defender are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure.
Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, <e2>Switzerland</e2>, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called <e1>APT-C-23</e1> targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on <e2>Facebook</e2>. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.
EXODUS ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by Italian app maker Connexxa, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. <e1>Exodus</e1> came to light when last month security researchers from Security Without Borders found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local <e2>Italian internet service provider (ISP)</e2>. They said the spyware was capable of rooting Android devices and possessed an advanced set of spying features that gave attackers full control of infected devices.
The <e1>Alien</e1> RAT service implements the following set of commands: Command Description rat_disconnect Disables the RAT service open_folder Lists files and subfolders in the specified folder uploadind_file Uploads the specified file to the C2 connect_teamviewer Provides credentials for the TeamViewer app and launches it open_team_viewer Launches the TeamViewer app send_settings Sends the current settings of RAT service to the C2 get_apps Gets the list of installed applications on the infected device After using the Trojan’s commands to install additional apps on the device, TeamViewer is installed but not yet enabled. Once the actor provides the credentials to set up the TeamViewer server connection, the Trojan uses the Accessibility privileges to access the TeamViewer application, logs in using the provided credentials, grant any additional permissions it requires to run and dismiss any warnings issued (if applicable). The following code snippet is handling those functions: When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access and change device settings, install and remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers and social networks). By monitoring the device in real-time, actors can also gain valuable insight into the user’s behavior. Note that although TeamViewer supports a wide range of device models, it does not guarantee a 100% coverage. On certain devices it only works in screen streaming mode, only allowing the actors to see what happens on the screen without being able to interact with it. Notification sniffer The Trojan is abusing the android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE permission to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. This permission is considered “risky”, which means that the user needs to grant it manually in the settings. Malware circumvents this countermeasure by using the <e2>Accessibility</e2> privileges, performing all necessary UI interaction by itself.
Messages are erased from the infected phone as soon as they're sent, making the malicious activity that much harder to track. <e1>RedDrop</e1>'s creators have cast a wide net. Wandera has already discovered more than <e2>50 Android apps</e2> infected with the Trojan.
Mobile malware, dubbed <e1>Rotexy</e1>, has evolved from being spyware to now a dangerous banking trojan packing a host of new clever features. Researchers report 70,000 attacks between August and October with targets primarily based in <e2>Russia</e2>. In a technical brief released last week, researchers at Kaspersky Lab shed new light on the Rotexy malware, which was first spotted in October 2014 as an SMS spyware trojan.
In propagation and theme, TangleBot resembles other mobile malware, such as the <e1>FluBot</e1> SMS malware that targets the U.K. and <e2>Europe</e2> or the CovidLock Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients.
This variant abuses Instagram and Tumblr profiles to hide its C&C server. <e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0 targets <e2>South Korean</e2> Android users.
Further analysis of the <e2>iOS</e2> app “Concipit1248” showed that the server used, spy[.]cashnow[.]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of Project Spy. However, although the “<e1>Concipit1248</e1>” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever.
For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The <e2>HackingTeam</e2>’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection.
In 2019, the malware introduced what seemed to be a nearly working ransomware component and spread using fraudulent apps on Google’s Play Store. <e1>Anubis</e1> reappeared last year with large-scale phishing attacks that targeted 250 <e2>shopping and financial applications</e2>. Anubis M.

This local port is used by <e2>Exodus</e2> Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases. However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone. The rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to TCP <e1>port 6200</e1> and issuing one of the following commands.

By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. Port 6209: Telegram extraction service. Port 6210: SBrowser extraction service. Port 6211: Calendar extraction service. <e1>Port 6212</e1>: Chrome extraction service.

As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, Germany, United States of America, Italy, <e2>France</e2>, Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
Once <e1>Gooligan</e1> has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real <e2>Google</e2> accounts.

How it’s different from the iOS version The biggest distinction between the iOS and Android versions of <e1>Pegasus</e1> is the <e2>Android</e2> version does not use zero-day vulnerabilities to root the device.
Called “<e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1>”, the banking trojan was available on <e2>Google Play</e2> at the time of the analysis.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Local and Remote Shells In order to execute commands on the infected devices, as well as to provide a reverse shell to the Command & Control operators, Exodus Two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null. Once launched, null will first verify whether it is able to fork on the system and that there is no other instance of itself currently running by checking whether the local port number 6842 is available. This payload will then attempt to instantiate a remote reverse /system/bin/sh shell to the Command & Control ws.my-local-weather[.]com on port 22011. It is worth noticing that this remote reverse shell does not employ any transport cryptography. The traffic transits in clear and is therefore potentially exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks: At the same time, null will also bind a local shell on 0.0.0.0:6842. This local port is used by Exodus Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases. However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone. The rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to TCP port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands. Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise <e2>Exodus</e2> One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b Exodus One Package Names com.

Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake <e2>WeMessage</e2> app was distributed.
An in-depth analysis of <e1>SpyNote</e1> remote access trojan Find out what a remote access trojan (RAT) is and see how it can affect its victims' devices. Lookout researchers have recently discovered a surveillance campaign targeting Syrian citizens and it is believed that the actor behind the attack was state-sponsored. The campaign had been active since January 2018 and its goal was to infect Android mobile devices with remote access trojans (RATs) and then spy on people in possession of those devices. The victims were tricked into downloading and installing innocent-looking mobile applications which were actually spyware. The applications were shared through various communication channels; however, they were never available on the official Google Play Store. Some applications attempted to masquerade as legitimate ones like Telegram, others were COVID-19 contact tracing apps or benign tools like a fake digital thermometer, and others impersonated <e2>Android built-in tools</e2>. The common factor was that all of them had an additional functionality: allowing the adversary to spy on the users who installed them.
This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of <e1>Android/Twitoor.A,</e1> can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined <e2>Twitter</e2> account at regular intervals for commands.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method <e1>_Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv</e1> from libdvm.
For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e2>Rotexy</e2> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file <e1>data.db</e1> with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage).
According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. "<e1>Gooligan</e1> potentially affects devices on Android 4 Jelly Bean and KitKat, and 5 Lollipop, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today. About 57 percent of these devices are located in Asia and about nine percent are in <e2>Europe</e2>," Check Point said.
After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on Google Play), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: <e1>RCS Android</e1> (Remote Control System Android). Unsurprisingly, it can do so many things and spy on so many levels that they consider it the most sophisticated <e2>Android</e2> malware ever exposed.
” Given that the <e1>RCS Android</e1> source code is now available to everybody, it will likely not take long for Android malware with some, most, or all of these capabilities to pop up and be sold on underground forums, and for all <e2>Android</e2> users to be in danger.
“The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that <e2>mobeebom</e2> probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name <e1>MobiHok</e1>.” In July 2016, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like OmniRat and DroidJack, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum.
” Alien Malware The <e1>Alien</e1> RAT has various commonly used <e2>Android</e2> malware capabilities, including the ability to launch overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages & harvest contact lists – as well as keylogging, location-collecting & other capabilities.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages 3 reqcalllog.php Upload specified file from the device to the C2 4 reqcalllog.php Download file from specified URL and save on device 5 reqcalllog.php Delete specified file 6,7,8 reqcalllog.php Commands not yet implemented 9 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with rear camera, send to C2 10 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with front camera, send to C2 All observed samples with Smali injections were signed by the same debug certificate (0x936eacbe07f201df). As we know from our investigation, traces of the first development activities were found at the end of 2016, but the main distribution campaign began in 2018 (end of 2017). Based on our detection statistics, the main infection vector is the spread of Trojanized applications directly to victims via Telegram and <e2>WhatsApp messengers</e2>. There are the following relevant detection paths (the last one is an alternative Telegram client – “Telegram X“): This would be a very unusual coincidence.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic <e2>France</e2> Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
Dubbed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> (Detected by Trend Micro as <e2>ANDROIDOS_BANKER</e2>) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both Android and Flash Player.
Permission <e1>Alien</e1> uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself. It does this using an advanced remote access feature that compromises the <e2>TeamViewer</e2> application, giving the bad player behind the malware remote control over the victim’s devices.

New versions of <e1>FakeSpy</e1> masquerade as government post office apps and transportation services apps. Our analysis indicates that the threat actors are no longer limiting their campaigns to <e2>East Asian</e2> countries, but are targeting additional countries around the world.
The use of a <e2>fake iOS App Store</e2> is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like ZergHelper. It also has exactly the same behavior as <e1>AceDeceiver</e1>. When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to input his or her Apple ID and password,” Xiao wrote.
Then in the next version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> trojan malware in 2015-2016, it starts using the AES algorithm to encrypt the data between the user’s device and C&C server. In 2017-2018 HTML phishing pages bank.html, <e1>update.html</e1> ad extortionist.

<e1>DualToy</e1> Windows Trojan Attacks Android, <e2>iOS</e2> Devices Researchers have found a malware family called DualToy that infects Windows PCs and sideloads malware onto connected Android and iOS devices.
Researchers discovered two apps, Currency Converter and BatterySaverMobo, used to spread <e1>Anubis</e1>. The threat actors also lure users into downloading the infected apps through phishing campaigns after stealing contact information from infected devices. Once the user downloads the Android banking trojan, the app monitors the device status to find the optimal time to execute attacks. The app can hijack two-factor authentication codes and hide the OTP SMS messages from the device user. Another feature allows the banking malware to detect whether the device is in motion by tapping into the motion sensor. When a device appears to be motionless for a long time, the banking malware operators conclude that the smartphone is running in a sandbox and used by researchers. They, therefore, abstain from executing attacks on the infected device. Analysis of Anubis source code reveals that the banking malware tampers with administrative settings to view running tasks as well as create a backdoor through Virtual Network Computing (VNC). In addition to stealing banking credentials, these permissions also allow the app to record audio, gain access to the contact list for spamming, send SMS messages, and make phone calls. The banking malware app also contains a ransomware component, called AnubisCrypt, able to encrypt files on both internal and SD storage. It can also receive commands from social media apps such as <e2>Twitter</e2>, which is the most common method of sending commands through shortened links.
<e1>RuMMS</e1>: The Latest Family of Android Malware Attacking Users in Russia Via SMS Phishing Introduction Recently we observed an Android malware family being used to attack users in <e2>Russia</e2>. The malware samples were mainly distributed through a series of malicious subdomains registered under a legitimate domain belonging to a well-known shared hosting service provider in Russia.
We named this specific <e2>Android</e2> Trojan “<e1>RootAngel</e1>”.
If you are interested in the detailed story behind how we found <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>Android</e2> and exactly what it does, read the full report here.
After downloading it, <e2>DualToy</e2> will copy the IPA file via the AFC service to the iOS device’s /var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging directory, and then install it via the installation_proxy service. The downloaded kuaiyong.ipa has an obfuscated bundle ID of “pWsbshWBn5XN9kk0twBUECAVt2E.dsE7UfuXZdinV60edM4u1Ul0d6hSf66akdZrmp”. It was signed by an enterprise certificate issued to “Ningbo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.” The certificate the app won’t be successfully installed on iOS devices anymore. However, the attacker could easily change the URL list replied by C2 server to push other apps. AceDeceiver-like behavior Since the kuaiyong.ipa has an expired certificate, we resigned it with a personal development certificate and then installed it on our testing device. The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like “ZergHelper”. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to input his or her Apple ID and password (Figure 15). The nearby disclaimer says the credentials won’t be uploaded to any server. However, through our reverse engineering and debugging, we discovered the Apple ID and password will be encrypted by DES algorithm by a fixed key of “HBSMY4yF” and 4 of “\x12\x34\x56\x78\x90\xab\xcd\xef”, and sent to the server <e1>proxy.mysjzs[.]com</e1> after encoding the ciphertext with Base64.
The code of the Google Authenticator 2FA stealer of the Alien Trojan is visible in following snippet: The Alien malware As described in previous sections, the <e1>Alien</e1> malware is a rented banking Trojan which offers more than the average capabilities of Android banking Trojans. It has common capabilities such as overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages and harvest the contact list. It can leverage its keylogger for any use and therefore broaden the attack scope further than its target list. It also offers the possibility to install, start and remove applications from the infected device. Most importantly, it offers a notifications sniffer, allowing it to get the content of all notifications on the infected device, and a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) feature (by abusing the <e2>TeamViewer</e2> application), meaning that the threat actors can perform the fraud from the victim’s device.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as <e1>hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK</e1> BRAND].
This APK contained the variant of <e1>XLoader</e1>, a family of malware that is capable of behaving as spyware and a banking Trojan. In the event an iOS user visited one of the malicious websites, the campaign redirected to another website that prompted them to download a malicious <e2>iOS configuration profile</e2>. The campaign claimed this profile would help the user’s device resolve a network issue that’s preventing the site from loading.
The immediate consequence to this, is that <e1>TangleBot</e1> gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications. The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things. Furthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the <e2>Android</e2> operating system.
New <e2>Android</e2> Malware <e1>RuMMS</e1> Targeting Users through Smishing FireEye security firms’ researchers have identified a new Android family malware that is currently targeting Russian users.
Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. <e1>APT-C-23</e1> has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and <e2>Egypt</e2>. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more.
ViceLeaker Android spyware targets users in the Middle East Experts at Kaspersky have uncovered a spyware campaign dubbed <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> that spreads in the Middle East to spy on <e2>Android</e2> users.
July 21 Analysis of the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> spying tool revealed that Hacking Team can listen to calls and roots devices to get in. July 28 A recent campaign compromised <e2>Taiwan</e2> and Hong Kong sites to deliver Flash exploits related to Hacking Team.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages 3 reqcalllog.php Upload specified file from the device to the C2 4 <e1>reqcalllog.php</e1> Download file from specified URL and save on device 5 reqcalllog.

TrickBot Mobile App Bypasses 2‐Factor Authentication for Net Banking Services The malware authors behind TrickBot banking Trojan have developed a new Android app that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to Internet banking customers via SMS or relatively more secure push notifications, and complete fraudulent transactions. The <e2>Android</e2> app, called "<e1>TrickMo</e1>" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware.
Researchers at Checkpoint spotted the malware and say it was hosted on apps created by Korean developers <e2>Kiniwini</e2>, registered as <e1>ENISTUDIO Corp</e1>. These included Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, Judy’s Happy House, and Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess.

This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 <e1>quostpeopls[.]com</e1> 24 6 bannerincbest[.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, <e2>banking apps</e2> belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.
In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting <e2>U.S.</e2> banks including Bank of America, U.
This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the <e2>Android</e2> version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered.
Researchers at ThreatFabric, the cybersecurity firm based in Amsterdam, have been following an “interesting new strain of banking malware” dubbed <e1>Ginp</e1> distributed as <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2>. Identified firstly by Kaspersky’s Android malware analyst Tatyana Shishkova in late October; Ginp is currently targeting users in the UK and Spain.
A cybersecurity research team has uncovered the “Mandrake” spying operation targeting Australian mobile banking users. <e1>Mandrake</e1> was first discovered earlier this year but is believed to be active since at least four years as a highly sophisticated spying platform. The threat actors behind the campaign have leveraged the rise in the usage of mobile banking in <e2>Australia</e2> to target individuals.
Finally, the app can remove itself through three ways: Via a command from the server Autoremove if the device has not been able to check in to the server after 60 days Via an antidote file. If <e1>/sdcard/MemosForNotes</e1> was present on the device, the <e2>Chrysaor</e2> app removes itself from the device.
This malware has been dubbed “<e1>TangleBot</e1>.” The moniker refers to the obfuscation methods used to take control over entangled device functionalities. Distribution takes place via text message and targets <e2>Android</e2> owners in North America.
In June 2019, the <e1>Ginp</e1> malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, Santander, and <e2>Kutxabank</e2>. According to researchers, Ginp may receive further modifications and exhibit many new malicious features along with expanding its targets.
As visible in the following chart, it seems that actors using <e1>Alien</e1> have a particular interest in the usual set of most targeted countries, such as but not limited to Spain, Turkey, Germany, United States of America, Italy, France, Poland, <e2>Australia</e2> and the United Kingdom.
" While <e1>Monokle</e1> currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the <e2>Caucasus</e2> region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria.

” It’s also with medium confidence that the researchers assess that <e1>Monarchy</e1> acts on behalf of the Saudi government. It targets individuals primarily inside <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2>, and was seen hacking a Saudi Arabian activist.
XLoader distributed via DNS domains <e1>XLoader</e1> was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate <e2>Facebook</e2> or Chrome apps.
Meanwhile, the <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as <e2>APT-C-23</e2>, is likely the suspect behind the malware.
On Android devices, <e1>DualToy</e1> installs several <e2>Chinese language apps</e2> that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers.
Permission <e1>Alien</e1> uses this tactic by abusing the:- <e2>“android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE”</e2> to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device.
But more recent variants of <e2>DualToy</e2> drop a custom ADB client, <e1>tadb.exe,</e1> onto a victim’s PC.
SpyNote RAT is capable of performing a variety of alarming functions that includes: Activating the device’s microphone and listening to live conversations Executing commands on the device Copying files from the device to a Command & Control (C&C) center Recording screen captures Viewing contacts Reading SMS messages The screenshot below shows part of the sandbox’s report on the SpyNote RAT’s signature and detected functions: The fake Netflix app we are analyzing in this blog appears to be built using an updated version of <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> builder, which was leaked last year. Technical details Please note that our research is not about the legitimate Netflix app on <e2>Google Play</e2>. The spyware in this analysis was portraying itself as the Netflix app.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module “ip” This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off “VerifyApps” and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the “com.qualcmm.timeservices” app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app <e1>com.qualcmm.timeservices</e1> As I mentioned before, in the “initial phase”, the Trojan will install the “com.
Successful iOS exploitation results in the <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> implant being written to the device at /tmp/updateserver. The implant is then started with the "run" command-line argument. It runs as root with various entitlements, giving it access to all the data the Evil Eye actor wishes to collect. Volexity has conducted an initial analysis of the payload delivered through the exploit chain and has been able to confirm successful exploitation of an iPhone running <e2>iOS 12.3.1</e2>. An overview of this entire chain is shown in the Figure below: INSOMNIA Implant Analysis Further analysis of the malicious binary indicates it appears to be an updated version of the implant described by Google's Project Zero in their Implant Teardown post, which was an updated version of what CitizenLab later described here.
Insidious Android malware gives up all malicious features but one to gain stealth ESET researchers have analyzed an extremely dangerous <e2>Android</e2> app that can perform a host of nefarious actions, notably wiping out the victim’s bank account or cryptocurrency wallet and taking over their email or social media accounts. Called “<e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1>”, the banking trojan was available on Google Play at the time of the analysis.
The attack campaign, named <e1>Gooligan</e1>, breached the security of over one million Google accounts. The number continues to rise at an additional 13,000 breached devices each day. Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, <e2>G Suite</e2>, Google Drive, and more.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, <e2>Car News</e2>, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner.

As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 <e1>sisirplus[.]com</e1> 172 2 vietusprotus[.
Screen capture and audio recording <e2>SpyNote RAT</e2> was able to take screen captures and, using the device’s microphone, listen to audio conversations. This capability was confirmed when the Android permission, called <e1>android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO,</e1> was being requested along with code found in the app.
Mazar BOT won’t run on Russian Android smartphones Our team was not surprised to observe that the malware cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with the Russian language option. <e2>Mazar BOT</e2> will check the phone to identify the victim’s country and this will stop the malicious APK if the targeted phone turns out to be owned by a Russian user: <e1>locale.getCountry () equalsIgnoreCase ( “RU”))</e1> Process.
Infecting Android Devices Almost all samples of <e2>DualToy</e2> are capable of infecting Android devices connected with the compromised Windows PC via USB cable. This functionality is usually implemented in a module named NewPhone.dll, <e1>DevApi.dll</e1> or app.
Lookout has observed samples that go back to March 2016, and its telemetry shows that activity appears to remain small but consistent, peaking during the first half of 2018 and continuing to the present day. <e1>Monokle</e1> has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the <e2>Ahrar al-Sham</e2> militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called Ahrar Maps made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham.

However, within six months the malicious actors added the capability to infect iOS devices. <e1>DualToy</e1> is still active and we have detected over 8,000 unique samples belonging to this Trojan family to date. It mainly targets Chinese users, but has also successfully affected people and organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, <e2>Thailand</e2>, Spain, and Ireland.
Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the <e2>Android</e2> recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing.
For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The HackingTeam’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken <e2>iOS</e2> devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection.
The Growth of XLoader Trend Micro first observed efforts to distribute <e1>XLoader</e1> disguised as legitimate Facebook and Chrome apps in April 2018. Just months later, the security firm observed that the malware had infected 384,748 victims, with the bulk of affected users located in South Korea and <e2>Japan</e2>. Also in April 2018, researchers at ESET discovered fake applications available for download on the Google Play store that simply inundated users with unwanted ads.
While it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region, at this time, we are seeing it deployed specifically in Germany. <e2>Germany</e2> is one of the first attack turfs <e1>TrickBot</e1> spread to when it first emerged in 2016.
Later the malware using local SQLite database, to store the data that harvested from infected mobile and an information about C&C servers. “<e2>Rotexy</e2> intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C. Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.” If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers. This trojan force users to enter only right credentials and it checks all the details against the data that it already received. Once the victim entered all the data then it checks the originality of the data and uploaded into C&C server.

" Cerberus is not seen as "moving the needle" for trojan capabilities, but it's dangerous nonetheless. "<e1>Cerberus</e1> should not be taken lightly," ThreatFabric warns. It can harvest contacts, send messages, steal credentials. And its overlays are not limited to banking apps—it can attack messaging or other accounts using the same techniques. The rental model is interesting—it ensures the malware can evolve and spread quickly, and it increases the likely damage during its lifespan. There is also the question of the apps coverage thus far—U.S., France and <e2>Japan</e2>. If those were created to order, then the rental model will quickly add more.
The sample examined is an instance of the <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1>. After the application is installed, it is displayed as Android with the icon resembling the one of the built-in Android applications Settings. AndroidManifest.xml file reveals that malware takes advantage of a number of permissions, allowing it to have, among others, the following capabilities: track location of the device (GPS and network-based) make and intercept calls access camera access external storage access contact list read SMS access microphone displaying content over other applications clickjacking via <e2>Accessibility Service</e2>s Technical details While the distribution channel for the application sample remains unknown, it was surely never available on the official Google Play Store.

This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, <e2>Sber Bank</e2>. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open.
Researchers from Palo Alto Networks said <e1>DualToy</e1> has been in existence since January 2015, and it originally was limited to installing unwanted apps and displaying mobile ads on Android devices. About six months later, the Trojan morphed and began targeting iOS devices by installing a third-party App Store in hopes of nabbing <e2>iTunes</e2> usernames and passwords.
<e1>Ginp</e1> Trojan Targets <e2>Android Banking App</e2> Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_Ginp.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving <e2>Cerberus</e2> and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: google.servlce.store <e1>gooogle.services</e1> goooogle.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 <e1>reqsmscal.php</e1> Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.

The use of a specific certificate and SSL verification means that the malware will not talk to just any listening HTTPS server, which adds complexity to analyzing <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> in a sandbox environment. To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to "trick" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen <e2>Signal</e2> data.

Copy files sux, logo.png and busybox_g1 that are dropped in the above step to /data/data/ <package_name>/app_bin Generate shell script <e1>/data/data/<package_name>/app_bin/toor.sh</e1> with the content depicted in Figure 5.
In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including Bank of America, <e2>U.S. Bank</e2>, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust and Wells Fargo,” Balaam said.
, has actively targeted institutions globally, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the <e2>UK</e2> & the US. Researchers think <e1>Alien</e1> is a “fork” of the infamous Cerberus banking malware, which has had a steady reduction in use over the last year.
It’s called <e1>Twitoor</e1>, and this Trojan apparently lies dormant on Android devices, and awaits commands from a malicious <e2>Twitter</e2> account.
Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV <e2>Hotstar</e2> Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come. Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same <e1>SpyNote</e1> Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild.
Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Researchers have warned that over half of Android devices are still susceptible to <e1>Ghost Push</e1> malware. Read More According to Check Point, which reported the issue to Google, these tokens can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, <e2>Google Photos</e2>, Google Docs, G Suite, and Google Drive.
Malicious Pokémon GO App Spreading DroidJack RAT An infected Android version of the <e2>Pokémon GO</e2> app is infecting unsuspecting users with the malicious remote access tool <e1>DroidJack</e1>. First released in the United States on July 6, Pokémon GO is a mobile game available for Android and iPhone.
Who is affected? <e1>Gooligan</e1> potentially affects devices on Android 4 (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5 (<e2>Lollipop</e2>), which is over 74% of in-market devices today.
Seeing <e1>Ursnif</e1> using <e2>Cerberus</e2> as its mobile malware component is new, but it is not surprising in the banking Trojan arena.
In this blog, we showed that the threat actor behind the recent <e1>FakeSpy</e1> campaign is a Chinese-speaking group called “Roaming Mantis” known to operate mainly in Asia. It is interesting to see that the group has expanded their operation to other regions, such as the <e2>United States</e2> and Europe.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia <e2>Austria</e2> Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, <e2>China</e2>, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise FakeSpy are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and Swiss Post. <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> used the Android developer tool <e2>WebView</e2> to build the fake applications, which is what gives them their authenticity, Almkias said.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, <e2>Horoskope</e2>, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner.
The developers behind <e1>Cerberus</e1> are reportedly renting the trojan out on the dark web and have taken the unusual step of advertising their capabilities on <e2>Twitter</e2>. The threat actors even use their Twitter account to mock the security community tasked with trying to stop them—and they are so confident, they even tried to sell the bot to a well known malware analyst so he could examine their work.
Trend Micro researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> (Remote Control System Android), which they says, is one of the "most professionally developed and sophisticated" pieces of <e2>Android</e2> malware a.
” In several <e2>Android</e2> samples of <e1>Monokle</e1>, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild.
It Starts With Social Engineering One of the recent features added to <e1>Ginp</e1> is the ability to make it appear as if a legitimate SMS message is being received on a device. The server sends a command called “INSERT_SMS,” which triggers the malware to effectively mimic the process of receiving a new SMS message. The messages reference documents that need to be signed or suspicious activity on a banking account—among other ploys—in an attempt to invoke a sense of urgency and persuade the victim to open his or her mobile banking application. An additional technique the malware uses is generating fake push notifications. The server can send a “PUSH_NOTIFY” command to generate a fake “push” notification and make it appear as if it’s coming from the <e2>banking app</e2>. Activate the Overlay In general, as soon as the victim uses his or her banking app, this activity is logged and sent to the C&C server.
Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of <e1>Exodus</e1> led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware. The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers. Researchers said that a company called <e2>eSurv S.R.L</e2>. was also involved.
According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the <e2>American</e2> ones.
ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent <e1>Ginp</e1> samples showed that it reused some code from <e2>Anubis</e2>, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan.
” So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread <e2>RuMMS</e2> in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider). The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (<e1>asdfgjcr</e1>, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious <e2>RCSAndroid</e2> agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of <e1>ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A</e1> and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the <e2>United States</e2> and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy.
It’s interesting that we can recover its original file name which is fb_mem_root. <e2>SpyDealer</e2> 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 also gain root privilege thought another method that doesn’t use “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drop files including sux, getroot, logo.png and busybox_g1 from assets to the app’s own data directory. Copy files sux, logo.png and busybox_g1 that are dropped in the above step to /data/data/ <package_name>/app_bin Generate shell script /data/data/<package_name>/app_bin/toor.sh with the content depicted in Figure 5. Execute png and toor.sh to gain root privilege, and these two files are deleted at the end. Readers should note that this second rooting method only targets Android versions from 4.0 to 4.3 (included). However, the exploits used in this attack remains unknown to us as none of logo.png, getroot or <e1>busybox_g1</e1> exists in the app’s assets.
Mobile <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> The following table shows meta information on the observed samples, including compiler timestamps: MD5 Package Compiler C2 51df2597faa3fce38a4c5ae024f97b1c com.xapps.SexGameForAdults dexlib 2.x 188.165.28[.]251 2d108ff3a735dea1d1fdfa430f37fab2 com.psiphon3 dexlib 2.x 188.165.49[.]205 7ed754a802f0b6a1740a99683173db73 com.psiphon3 dexlib 2.x 188.165.49[.]205 3b89e5cd49c05ce6dc681589e6c368d9 ir.abed.dastan dexlib 2.x 185.141.60[.]213 To backdoor legitimate applications, attackers used a Smali injection technique – a type of injection that allows attackers to disassemble the code of original app with the Baksmali tool, add their malicious code, and assemble it with Smali. As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages 3 reqcalllog.php Upload specified file from the device to the C2 4 reqcalllog.php Download file from specified URL and save on device 5 reqcalllog.php Delete specified file 6,7,8 reqcalllog.php Commands not yet implemented 9 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with rear camera, send to C2 10 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with front camera, send to C2 All observed samples with Smali injections were signed by the same debug certificate (0x936eacbe07f201df). As we know from our investigation, traces of the first development activities were found at the end of 2016, but the main distribution campaign began in 2018 (end of 2017). Based on our detection statistics, the main infection vector is the spread of Trojanized applications directly to victims via <e2>Telegram</e2> and WhatsApp messengers.
New Malware campaign <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> targeting <e2>Android</e2> Devices: Researchers Security researchers revealed an ongoing Android malware campaign dubbed ViceLeaker that has been active since 2016.
Identified firstly by Kaspersky’s Android malware analyst Tatyana Shishkova in late October; <e1>Ginp</e1> is currently targeting users in the <e2>UK</e2> and Spain.
They weren’t able to determine the identity of <e1>Center-1</e1> and Center-2, though both appear to target mainly in the <e2>Middle East</e2>. The firm said that it believes that NSO Group is constantly working to develop new vectors of infection.

FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> first targeted South Korean and <e2>Japanese</e2> speakers.
Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that <e1>Ginp</e1> malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of Turkish banks, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in <e2>Poland</e2> and the United Kingdom.
Android '<e1>Gooligan</e1>' Hackers Just Scored The Biggest Ever Theft Of <e2>Google</e2> Accounts A new variant of Android malware is responsible for what's believed to be the biggest single theft of Google accounts on record.
ESET security researcher Lukas Stefanko told me he "found <e1>Cerberus</e1> in June, a couple of days after it was published on an underground forum." Stefanko used Twitter to ask the research community if anyone had come across it before, "and that is when I noticed their twitter handle joined the debate under my tweet." "Even though they know I am <e2>android</e2> malware analyst," Stefanko told me, "they tried to sell me their Cerberus bot.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.
<e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1>: New <e2>Android</e2> banking trojan can block and log incoming calls from banks New families of trojans continue to prosper on the Android platform as malicious hackers increasingly target mobile users in their attempt to steal login credentials and personal information.
However, it is possible that set of command change in future for <e1>Rotexy</e1> Trojan. Also, As per Kaspersky 98% users are targeted in Russia only rest few cases have seen in Ukraine, Turkey, <e2>Germany</e2>, and a few other countries.
Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, <e2>Google Play</e2>, lending the apps a level of credibility.
” It’s also with medium confidence that the researchers assess that <e1>Monarchy</e1> acts on behalf of the Saudi government. It targets individuals primarily inside Saudi Arabia, and was seen hacking a <e2>Saudi Arabian activist</e2>. They weren’t able to determine the identity of Center-1 and Center-2, though both appear to target mainly in the Middle East.
Moreover, <e1>XLoader</e1> and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in <e2>Japan</e2> and South Korea.
All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, <e1>Game322.res,</e1> Game323.
The use of a <e2>fake iOS App Store</e2> is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver.
By manipulating a SQLite database, <e2>Exodus</e2> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. <e1>Port 6209</e1>: Telegram extraction service.
0 Lollipop may also be in danger of being targeted, as some emails sent among Hacking Team executives indicates that "<e1>Hacking Team</e1> was in the process of developing exploits for <e2>Android 5.0 Lollipop</e2>," but so far there is no such indication.
<e1>Judy</e1> malware may have infected 36 million Android devices. Here's how to protect yourself Android malware spread by around 50 apps in the <e2>Google Play Store</e2> may have infected up to 36 million devices, security researchers at Checkpoint have warned.
This will allow the attackers to: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Our team has identified the malicious APK to be the <e1>Mazar Android BOT</e1>, a threat also that Recorded Future spotted in November 2015. The malicious packet (APK) retrieves TOR and installs it on the victim’s phone via the following harmless URLs: https: //f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android https: //play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android In the next phase of the attack, the infection will unpack and run the TOR application, which will then be used to connect to the following server: http: // pc35hiptpcwqezgs [.] Onion. After that, an automated SMS will be sent to the number 9876543210 (+98 is the country code for Iran) with the text message: “Thank you”. The catch is that this SMS also includes the device’s location data. Insidious mobile malware with crippling options This specific mobile malware opens the doors to all kinds of malicious consequences for the victim. Attackers can: Open a backdoor into <e2>Android</e2> smartphones, to monitor and control them as they please; Send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, seriously increasing the victim’s phone bill; Read SMS messages, which means they can also read authentication codes sent as part of two-factor authentication mechanisms, used also by online banking apps and ecommerce websites; Use their full access to Android phones to basically manipulate the device to do whatever they want.
Target types Based on the application types provided by Google, we can see based on the targeted applications that although the <e1>Anubis</e1> Trojan is a banker and therefore mainly targets <e2>“Finance” apps</e2>, it also has interest in other types of apps.
Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of <e1>FakeSpy</e1> target not only Korean and <e2>Japanese</e2> speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world.
Geography of Rotexy attacks According to our data, 98% of all <e2>Rotexy</e2> attacks target users in Russia. Indeed, the Trojan explicitly targets Russian-speaking users. There have also been cases of users in Ukraine, Germany, Turkey and several other countries being affected. Kaspersky Internet Security for Android and the Sberbank Online app securely protect users against attacks by this Trojan. IOCs SHA256 0ca09d4fde9e00c0987de44ae2ad51a01b3c4c2c11606fe8308a083805760ee7 4378f3680ff070a1316663880f47eba54510beaeb2d897e7bbb8d6b45de63f96 76c9d8226ce558c87c81236a9b95112b83c7b546863e29b88fec4dba5c720c0b 7cc2d8d43093c3767c7c73dc2b4daeb96f70a7c455299e0c7824b4210edd6386 9b2fd7189395b2f34781b499f5cae10ec86aa7ab373fbdc2a14ec4597d4799ba ac216d502233ca0fe51ac2bb64cfaf553d906dc19b7da4c023fec39b000bc0d7 b1ccb5618925c8f0dda8d13efe4a1e1a93d1ceed9e26ec4a388229a28d1f8d5b ba4beb97f5d4ba33162f769f43ec8e7d1ae501acdade792a4a577cd6449e1a84 ba9f4d3f4eba3fa7dce726150fe402e37359a7f36c07f3932a92bd711436f88c e194268bf682d81fc7dc1e437c53c952ffae55a9d15a1fc020f0219527b7c2ec С&C 2014–2015: <e1>secondby.ru</e1> darkclub.
Dubbed <e1>Judy</e1>, due to many of the apps containing a character of the same name, the malicious code was installed when the applications were downloaded. Researchers at Checkpoint spotted the malware and say it was hosted on apps created by Korean developers Kiniwini, registered as ENISTUDIO Corp. These included Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, Judy’s Happy House, and <e2>Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess</e2>. The Israeli firm says the Judy malware is "an auto-clicking adware" that makes money for its creators by falsifying clicks on online adverts.
“This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives,” researchers said. Originally, the trojan was identified as <e1>Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief,</e1> but as it grew more sophisticated researchers assigned it to another family – Trojan-Banker.
The attack campaign, named <e1>Gooligan</e1>, breached the security of over one million Google accounts. The number continues to rise at an additional 13,000 breached devices each day. Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, <e2>Google Photos</e2>, Google Docs, G Suite, Google Drive, and more.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices.

Security researchers discover iOS version of Exodus Android spyware <e1>Exodus</e1> iOS spyware used against Italian and Turkmenistan users. Security researchers have discovered the iOS counterpart of a dangerous Android spyware strain that was seen earlier this year on the official <e2>Google Play Store</e2>. The good news, according to security researchers from cyber-security firm Lookout, is that the iOS version is less sophisticated than the Android variant and has not yet been distributed via the official Apple App Store.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

” In several Android samples of <e1>Monokle</e1>, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of <e2>Russia</e2>. Researchers attributed the RAT to Special Technology Center (STC), a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U.

Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, Google Drive, and more. <e1>Gooligan</e1> is a new variant of the Android malware campaign found by our researchers in the <e2>SnapPea</e2> app last year.
This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e2>RuMMS v2.0</e2>. App Details App name: Сooбщениe Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e Package Name: ru.row.glass Detailed Description Download and installation The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the "Unknown Sources" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command "40" and the names of apps. We noticed that command "40" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 campuphome[.]com 9 8 wewelowertick[.]com 3 9 bigslogous[.]com 25 10 <e1>zavannerweb[.]com</e1> 55 Conclusion A new and improved RuMMS is back in full force as RuMMS v2.
A, respectively). <e1>Project Spy</e1> uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates. We also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app after further investigation. However, we have noted a significantly small number of downloads of the app in Pakistan, <e2>India</e2>, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia.
“This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives,” researchers said. Originally, the trojan was identified as Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but as it grew more sophisticated researchers assigned it to another family – <e1>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy.</e1> Rotexy’s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of antivirus or banking applications).
Droidjack made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. <e1>OmniRat</e1> is similar in function and was first spotted in <e2>Germany</e2> in November by researchers who said targeted victims received a text message asking them to download an app to view an image.
“When <e1>DualToy</e1> began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting <e2>Android</e2> devices… We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015.
This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes. All the detections of this backdoored app were geolocated in Iran.

Volexity refers to this implant by the name <e2>INSOMNIA</e2>. Volexity observed multiple different attacks where this implant was being installed on iOS devices. This includes six different exploit websites; five instances of the malware implant; three different C2 IP and port pair combination; and two unique C2 IP addresses. Each of the observed exploit sites and malware C2 servers are detailed in Appendix A below. Targeting Website Visitors The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites. Volexity observed a total of six different hostnames being used to launch attacks between January and March 2020. While the first round of attacks were identified across several websites, future attacks were only observed in conjunction with the Uyghur Academy website. The attacks were largely loaded in fairly standard ways, such as via an iframe on a website's index, a modified JavaScript file used by the website, or nested iframes—which was the case on the Uyghur Academy website. The code below has been on the main index of the Uyghur Academy website for several months. The "JPlayer.html" file appears to be exclusively used by the Evil Eye actor when they want to launch attacks against visitors to the website. Otherwise, the file is either deleted or emptied out when not in use. In the first observed example of this iOS exploit actvity, the following code was observed inside Jplayer.html. The most notable method of loading the code was via an iframe that was observed on the Chinese-language version of the Uighur Times website. The following code was observed. Here, the entire iframe has been obfuscated by using base64 encoding, which is a common method to embed images in the source of websites. However, it is far less common to see an iframe load content from a remote website; this may be used as an indicator of suspect activity. The base64 content in this iframe decodes as follows: Targeting Website Visitors The index.html file hosted on <e1>cdn.doublesclick[.]me</e1> would kick off the first step in potential targeting against the user.
An in-depth analysis of <e1>SpyNote</e1> remote access trojan Find out what a remote access trojan (RAT) is and see how it can affect its victims' devices. Lookout researchers have recently discovered a surveillance campaign targeting Syrian citizens and it is believed that the actor behind the attack was state-sponsored. The campaign had been active since January 2018 and its goal was to infect Android mobile devices with remote access trojans (RATs) and then spy on people in possession of those devices. The victims were tricked into downloading and installing innocent-looking mobile applications which were actually spyware. The applications were shared through various communication channels; however, they were never available on the official Google Play Store. Some applications attempted to masquerade as legitimate ones like <e2>Telegram</e2>, others were COVID-19 contact tracing apps or benign tools like a fake digital thermometer, and others impersonated Android built-in tools.
Local and Remote Shells In order to execute commands on the infected devices, as well as to provide a reverse shell to the Command & Control operators, <e2>Exodus</e2> Two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null. Once launched, null will first verify whether it is able to fork on the system and that there is no other instance of itself currently running by checking whether the local port number 6842 is available. This payload will then attempt to instantiate a remote reverse /system/bin/sh shell to the Command & Control ws.my-local-weather[.]com on <e1>port 22011</e1>. It is worth noticing that this remote reverse shell does not employ any transport cryptography.
Detailed Technical Analysis Service Launching and Configuration After installed on an Android device, <e2>SpyDealer</e2> shows no application icon. However, it registers two broadcast receivers to listen for events related to the device booting up and network connection status. Whenever any of these events are broadcasted, the key service component AaTService starts. At the first launch, it retrieves configuration information from the local asset file named <e1>readme.txt.</e1> The first line of this file indicates the IP address of a remote C2 server, the second line configures what actions the malware can take on mobile networks, and the third line specifies what actions are allowed under a Wi-Fi network.
Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. <e1>Monokle</e1> supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and <e2>Snapchat</e2>. The malicious code, in fact, is able to read text notifications displayed on a device’s screen.

This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple’s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple’s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise’s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user’s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the <e2>Android</e2> version and use similar communications protocols.

STEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION <e2>FakeSpy</e2> has multiple built in information stealing capabilities. The first function is used for contact information stealing: the function upCon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information. Then, it sends it to the C2 server using the URL that ends with /servlet/ContactUpload. The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number and contact’s phone number Contacts - A headline used for the attacker to distinguish between the type of stolen information he gets Name - Contact’s full name (Display name) For testing purposes we inserted a fake contacts list to our Android Emulator and observed resultant behavior. The second stealing function is the onStartCommand, which steals infected device data and additional information. The stolen data is sent to the C2 server using the URL ending with /servlet/xx. The stolen data fields are: Mobile - The infected device phone number Machine - The device model (in our example: Google Pixel 2) <e1>Sversion</e1> - The OS version Bank - Checks if there are any banking-related or cryptocurrency trading apps Provider - The telecommunication provider (IMSI value in device settings) npki - Checks if the folder named NPKI (National Public Key Infrastructure) might contain authentication certificates related to financial transactions FakeSpy asks to be the default SMS app because it uses the function onReceive to intercept incoming SMS messages.
After downloading it, <e2>DualToy</e2> will copy the IPA file via the AFC service to the iOS device’s /var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging directory, and then install it via the installation_proxy service. The downloaded kuaiyong.ipa has an obfuscated bundle ID of “pWsbshWBn5XN9kk0twBUECAVt2E.dsE7UfuXZdinV60edM4u1Ul0d6hSf66akdZrmp”. It was signed by an enterprise certificate issued to “Ningbo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.” The certificate the app won’t be successfully installed on iOS devices anymore. However, the attacker could easily change the URL list replied by C2 server to push other apps. AceDeceiver-like behavior Since the <e1>kuaiyong.ipa</e1> has an expired certificate, we resigned it with a personal development certificate and then installed it on our testing device.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in <e2>Tokyo</e2>. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo.
On <e2>Android</e2> devices, <e1>DualToy</e1> installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers.

An investigation of <e1>Chrysaor</e1> Malware on <e2>Android</e2> Google is constantly working to improve our systems that protect users from Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs).
The fake applications are built using WebView, a popular extension of Android’s View class that lets the developer show a webpage. <e2>FakeSpy</e2> uses this view to redirect users to the original post office carrier webpage on launch of the application, continuing the deception. This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface. FAKESPY CODE ANALYSIS Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources. This configuration can be toggled on by going to ‘Settings’ -> ‘Security’ -> ‘Unknown Resources’. PackageInstaller shows the app’s permission access and asks for the user's approval, which then installs the application. This analysis dissects FakeSpy’s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions. DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOADING Once the application has finished the installation process, the malware starts its real malicious activity. The malicious application da.hao.pao.bin (Chunghwa Post) loads a library file libmsy.so used to execute the packed mycode.jar file. The JAR file is the decrypted version of the file tong.luo, which is located in the assets folder. By comparing the sizes of the encrypted asset file tong.luo vs the decrypted JAR file mycode.jar, it is interesting to note that it is the same file (almost the same size). After libmsy.so decrypts the asset file tong.luo, it loads <e1>mycode.jar</e1> dynamically into FakeSpy’s process, as is shown from the output of the “adb logcat” command.
The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.

Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs.
<e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> builder The <e2>SpyNote</e2> Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness.
As it does with <e2>Android</e2> devices, <e1>DualToy</e1> will check whether the iOS device was previously paired so that it can reuse existing pairing record (Figure 10).
In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, <e2>Chase</e2>, SunTrust and Wells Fargo,” Balaam said.

According to public records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. <e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities. Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering. Disguised Spyware Uploaded on Google Play Store We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded. While details would vary, all of the identified copies of this spyware shared a similar disguise. In most cases they would be crafted to appear as applications distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Italy. Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page. All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian. According to Google, whom we have contacted to alert about our discoveries, nearly 25 variants of this spyware were uploaded on Google Play Store. Google Play has removed the apps and they stated that "thanks to enhanced detection models, Google Play Protect will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications". While Google did not share with us the total number of infected devices, they confirmed that one of these malicious apps collected over 350 installations through the <e2>Play Store</e2>, while other variants collected few dozens each, and that all infections were located in Italy.
According to Kalember, the <e1>TangleBot</e1> malware has the capability to show hacked users an "overlay" screen that appears authentic but is instead a fake window being run by attackers to steal information. These overlays are being used to hack banking credentials because the users might believe they are logging into their mobile banking while typing in their information on a fake screen, which then relays the information to the hackers. "I would hope that [users] would remember the <e2>Adobe Flash</e2> prompt but after that they probably won't see very much from TangleBot," Kalember said.

Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of <e1>Exodus</e1> led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware. The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. <e2>Connexxa</e2> is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus.

All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company <e2>Connexxa S.R.L.</e2> The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators”.
UDP/TCP Client Aside from the TCP server that passively waits for the commands, <e2>SpyDealer</e2> can also actively connect to the remote server with the configured IP address to ask for commands through UDP or TCP. At first launch, the remote server’s IP address is retrieved from the local asset <e1>readme.txt,</e1> and the use of UDP or TCP protocols is determined based on another local asset named socket.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Throughout 2017, many actors used <e2>Bankbot</e2> for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

It’s interesting that <e2>Triout</e2>, which is detected by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, was first submitted from Russia, and most scans/reports came from Israel. The sample’s first appearance seems to be May 15, 2018, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, but it’s unclear how the tainted sample is disseminated. Third-party marketplaces or some other attacker-controlled domains are likely used to host the sample. A subsequent investigation revealed that the spyware has the following capabilities: Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php) Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php) Has capability to hide self Can send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C <e1>(calllog.php)</e1> Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C (uppc.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 <e1>reqsmscal.php</e1> Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.

The Android app, called “TrickMo” by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German (in September 2019) users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware.
The following is a review of scope and impact of the <e2>Chrysaor</e2> app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable. Content observers: use Android's ContentObserver framework to gather changes in SMS, Calendar, Contacts, Cell info, Email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Kakao, Viber, and Skype. Screenshots: captures an image of the current screen via the raw frame buffer. Keylogging: record input events by hooking IPCThreadState::Transact from <e1>/system/lib/libbinder.so,</e1> and intercepting android::parcel with the interface com.

The malicious packet (APK) retrieves TOR and installs it on the victim’s phone via the following harmless URLs: https: //f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android https: //play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android In the next phase of the attack, the infection will unpack and run the TOR application, which will then be used to connect to the following server: http: // pc35hiptpcwqezgs [.] Onion. After that, an automated SMS will be sent to the number 9876543210 (+98 is the country code for Iran) with the text message: “Thank you”. The catch is that this SMS also includes the device’s location data. Insidious mobile malware with crippling options This specific mobile malware opens the doors to all kinds of malicious consequences for the victim. Attackers can: Open a <e2>backdoor</e2> into Android smartphones, to monitor and control them as they please; Send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, seriously increasing the victim’s phone bill; Read SMS messages, which means they can also read authentication codes sent as part of two-factor authentication mechanisms, used also by online banking apps and ecommerce websites; Use their full access to Android phones to basically manipulate the device to do whatever they want.

The use of a specific certificate and SSL verification means that the malware will not talk to just any listening HTTPS server, which adds complexity to analyzing <e1>INSOMNIA</e1> in a sandbox environment. To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to "trick" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified. Functionality & Targeted Applications As described in the Project Zero and CitizenLab posts, the malware contains a list of applications for which it will steal data automatically if they are installed. Since the last analysis, the following applications have been added to this list: Signal (org.whispersystems.signal) ProtonMail (ch.protonmail.protonmail) The inclusion of these apps suggests they are being more commonly used by the Uyghur community than before. In particular, the inclusion of Signal and ProtonMail may suggest that the Uyghurs are aware of potential monitoring of their communications and are attempting to use applications with strong security features to avoid this. It is also worth noting that this implant also targets the popular messaging app <e2>WeChat</e2>. This app is referenced as "com.
Permission <e1>Alien</e1> uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself. It does this using an advanced remote access feature that compromises the TeamViewer application, giving the bad player behind the malware remote control over the victim’s devices. TeamViewer is a proprietary software application used for remote control, desktop & online meetings. Remote Control “When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access & change device settings, install & remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers & <e2>social networks</e2>),” outlined researchers.
Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Ginp Malware Operations are on the Rise, Aiming to Expand in Turkey The <e1>Ginp</e1> mobile banking malware, which emerged in late 2019, is one of the top most prevalent Android banking malware families today. It started as a SMS stealer and rapidly evolved into one of the most advanced actors in the financial fraud landscape. Ginp has primarily targeted Spanish banks, but recent evidence suggests the malware has changed or may change its targeting strategy in the near future to focus on Turkey. The following chart shows infection rates for different <e2>Android</e2> malware families from the last 90 days and demonstrates that Ginp accounts for nearly 12% of infections during this time.
An even higher degree of compromise: Chrome injects As if it weren’t enough that it can stop calls and launch other aggressive commands on the victim’s phone, <e1>Mazar BOT</e1> is also capable of injecting itself into <e2>Chrome</e2>. And there are several other settings and commands that Mazar BOT can trigger, as showcased below.
During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source <e1>Jabber/XMPP</e1> called “<e2>Conversations</e2>.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app.
The Unit 42 also noted that SpyNot OmniRat and DroidJack. <e1>OmniRat</e1> was detected in 2015 targeting MAC, <e2>Windows</e2> or Andriod operating system while DroidJack RAT was found also found in fake Pokémon Go apps on Android store.
Another interesting feature in <e2>FakeSpy</e2>’s code is the collection of the device's IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) number and all installed applications using the function upAppinfos. It sends all of this data to the C2 server using the URL ending with <e1>/servlet/AppInfos</e1>. FakeSpy is able to check the network connectivity status by using the function isNetworkAvailable.
If the recipient clicks on the links in these messages, malicious code is downloaded onto the Android device that installs the <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware. The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday. FakeSpy has been active in the wild since at least 2017. Its operators have been refining the information stealer’s code over the last three years and adding capabilities, according to Cybereason. The latest version has a larger target list that includes the U.S. and <e2>Europe</e2>. "The threat actors are preying on unsuspecting victims because people tend to open emails and messages when it comes to their deliveries," Assaf Dahan, senior director and head of threat research at Cybereason, tells Information Security Media Group.

It is worth noting that Bitdefender also reported about the campaign in one of their recent blog posts, therefore, Kaspersky isn’t the only firm to have detected the malware campaign. Initial analysis revealed that hackers were targeting “dozens of mobile <e2>Android</e2> devices belonging to Israeli citizens.

Volexity refers to this implant by the name <e1>INSOMNIA</e1>. Volexity observed multiple different attacks where this implant was being installed on iOS devices. This includes six different exploit websites; five instances of the malware implant; three different C2 IP and port pair combination; and two unique C2 IP addresses. Each of the observed exploit sites and malware C2 servers are detailed in Appendix A below. Targeting Website Visitors The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites. Volexity observed a total of six different hostnames being used to launch attacks between January and March 2020. While the first round of attacks were identified across several websites, future attacks were only observed in conjunction with the Uyghur Academy website. The attacks were largely loaded in fairly standard ways, such as via an iframe on a website's index, a modified JavaScript file used by the website, or nested iframes—which was the case on the Uyghur Academy website. The code below has been on the main index of the Uyghur Academy website for several months. The "JPlayer.html" file appears to be exclusively used by the Evil Eye actor when they want to launch attacks against visitors to the website. Otherwise, the file is either deleted or emptied out when not in use. In the first observed example of this <e2>iOS</e2> exploit actvity, the following code was observed inside Jplayer.
]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 <e1>reqsmscal.php</e1> Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.
But once downloaded, <e1>Gooligan</e1> determines which Android phone it's infected and launches the appropriate exploits to "root" the device -- i.e. take complete control over it. To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as VROOT and Towelroot, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, KitKat and Lollipop. Together, those operating systems account for 74 per cent of Android devices in use today, totalling around 1.03 billion. Most infections (40 per cent) are in Asia, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in North America, Shaulov said. Another 12 per cent are based in <e2>Europe</e2>. Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on.

Android users warned of malware attack spreading via SMS Security researchers are warning owners of <e2>Android</e2> smartphones about a new malware attack, spreading via SMS text messages. As the team at Scandinavian security group CSIS describes, malware known as <e1>MazarBOT</e1> is being distributed via SMS in Denmark and is likely to also be encountered in other countries.
They should first review the permissions requested, as only the malicious version containing <e1>DroidJack</e1> requests the ability to modify SMS messages and record audio. Players can also check the SHA256 hash of the downloaded APK to see if it matches that of the real Pokémon GO app. Going forward, mobile users should be careful about from where they decide to install applications onto their applications. Proofpoint elaborates: “Even though this APK has not been observed in the wild, it represents an important proof of concept: namely, that cybercriminals can take advantage of the popularity of applications like <e2>Pokemon GO</e2> to trick users into installing malware on their devices.
” Newer features coming to Anubis banking trojan The <e1>Anubis</e1> banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating <e2>Yandex maps</e2> into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone.

A TrickMo Kill Switch One of the most interesting features of the <e2>TrickMo</e2> malware is having its own kill switch. Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo’s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the “4” key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You’re Infected? The following SMS message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key: HrLbpr3x/htAVnAgYepBuH2xmFDb68TYTt7FwGn0ddGlQJv/hqsctL57ocFU0Oz3L+uhLcOGG7GVBAfHKL1TBQ== Sending this SMS will trigger TrickMo’s kill switch by sending the string “4” encrypted with the generated RSA public key and base64 encoded.

By manipulating a SQLite database, <e1>Exodus</e1> is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. Port 6209: Telegram extraction service. Port 6210: SBrowser extraction service. Port 6211: Calendar extraction service. Port 6212: Chrome extraction service. Local and Remote Shells In order to execute commands on the infected devices, as well as to provide a reverse shell to the Command & Control operators, Exodus Two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null. Once launched, null will first verify whether it is able to fork on the system and that there is no other instance of itself currently running by checking whether the local port number 6842 is available. This payload will then attempt to instantiate a remote reverse /system/bin/sh shell to the Command & Control ws.my-local-weather[.]com on port 22011. It is worth noticing that this remote reverse shell does not employ any transport cryptography. The traffic transits in clear and is therefore potentially exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks: At the same time, null will also bind a local shell on 0.0.0.0:6842. This local port is used by Exodus Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases. However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone. The rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to TCP port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands. Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise Exodus One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b <e2>Exodus</e2> One Package Names com.

Dubbed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> (Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both <e2>Android</e2> and Flash Player.
By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at <e2>Google Play</e2> (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads.
Experts from threat intelligence firm SenseCy spotted a new piece of Android RAT, dubbed <e1>MobiHok</e1> RAT, that used code from the old SpyNote RAT. At the beginning of July 2019, the experts spotted a threat actor dubbed mobeebom that was offering for sale an Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT) dubbed MobiHok v4 on a prominent English hacking forum. The experts discovered that mobeebom is active on multiple Arab-speaking hacking forums under different pseudonyms, a circumstance that suggests that he is an Arab-speaker. Researchers also noticed that the posts published by the hacker were using poor English. mobeebom has been promoting the <e2>MobiHok RAT</e2> through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since January 2019.

INTRODUCTION For the past several weeks, Cybereason has been investigating a new version of <e2>Android</e2> malware dubbed <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first identified in October 2017 and reported again in October 2018.
0 Android Trojan that first came to light last year is being advertised on underground sites for anyone to rent. <e1>Red Alert</e1> is capable of stealing tons of sensitive information from infected mobile devices including SMS messages, contact details, information about WiFi networks, call logs, and data about current or recently running tasks. It can also initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm, block calls from banks and connect with bots via <e2>Twitter</e2> in case its command and control server (C&C) happens to go offline.
While <e1>TrickMo</e1> is being currently deployed against TrickBot victims in <e2>Germany</e2>, researchers say that it can be used to target any bank or region — and they expect to see frequent changes and updates in the future.
Warning As Devious New Android Malware Hides In Fake <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2> Installations (Updated) Millions of Android users are being warned about a devious new banking trojan, dubbed <e1>Cerberus</e1>, that infects devices by masquerading as an Adobe Flash Player installation.
With different botnets and configurations, <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan <e2>Belarus</e2> Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.
“However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based <e1>MobiHok</e1> on the source code of another prominent <e2>Android</e2> RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.
Based on the leaked code, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, <e2>Line</e2>, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server, it receives instructions via tweets. <e1>Android/Twitoor</e1> is a backdoor capable of downloading other malware onto an infected device. It has been active for around one month. This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of Android/Twitoor.A, can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one. “Using Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” says Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. Malware that enslaves devices to form botnets needs to be able to receive updated instructions. That communication is an Achilles heel for any botnet – it may raise suspicion and, cutting the bots off is always lethal to the botnet’s functioning. Additionally, should the command-and-control (C&C) servers get seized by the authorities, it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet. To make the Twitoor botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it’s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,” explains Štefanko. In the Windows space, Twitter, founded in 2006, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. Android bots have also already been found being controlled via other non-traditional means – blogs or some of the many cloud messaging systems like Google’s or Baidu’s – but <e2>Twitoor</e2> is the first Twitter-based bot malware, according to Štefanko.
But <e1>Ginp</e1>’s authors did not stop there, repeatedly replenishing its arsenal with more inventive capabilities. For instance, the malware started using push notifications and pop-up messages to get the victim to open certain apps — those that it can overlay with phishing windows. The notifications are cleverly worded to lull the user into expecting to see a form for entering bank card data. Below is an example (in Spanish): <e2>Google Pay</e2>: Nos faltan los detalles de su tarjeta de crédito o débito.

According to a recent blog post from ESET, there’s a new kind of mobile malware that makes use of <e2>Twitter</e2> to control an Android device-based botnet. It’s the first known mobile malware to use this kind of social media account instead of a command-and-control server to exercise its power over infected devices. It’s called <e1>Twitoor</e1>, and this Trojan apparently lies dormant on Android devices, and awaits commands from a malicious Twitter account.
Furthermore, according to researchers, <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> continues to be updated with functionality recently added to block incoming calls from banks, including those which may be from financial fraud departments investigating potential malicious activity. In short, your <e2>Android</e2> phone gets infected by Red Alert 2.
More on Anubis Malware <e1>Anubis</e1> is a mobile malware that affects <e2>Android</e2> smartphones and is spread using malicious apps listed on the legitimate Google Play store.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner. All have now been removed from <e2>Google Play</e2>, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that Facebook and YouTube pages advertising some of them were still up.
Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise FakeSpy are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and Swiss Post. <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> used the <e2>Android</e2> developer tool WebView to build the fake applications, which is what gives them their authenticity, Almkias said.
In a statement provided to Citizen Lab researchers before the publication of today's report, an <e2>NSO Group</e2> spokesperson denied that the company was breaking any software export laws, adhering to the previously stated dogma that they're only selling <e1>Pegasus</e1> for crime-fighting purposes.
The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> is being deployed in targeted attacks against <e2>Middle Eastern</e2> individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers.
Trend Micro researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling RCSAndroid (<e1>Remote Control System Android</e1>), which they says, is one of the "most professionally developed and sophisticated" pieces of <e2>Android</e2> malware a.
For simplicity, we’ll reference this as <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: <e2>NSO Group</e2> has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals.

Creepy New Android Malware Can Secretly Record Your Conversations Security researchers have discovered nasty new <e2>Android</e2> malware that's purpose-built for blackmail. It's called <e1>RedDrop</e1>, and it's a bit nastier than run-of-the-mill ransomware.
A, respectively). <e1>Project Spy</e1> uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates. We also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app after further investigation. However, we have noted a significantly small number of downloads of the app in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, <e2>Iran</e2>, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia.
Our research team analyzed the malicious Android application that is most likely being spread by <e1>TrickBot</e1> and dubbed it “<e2>TrickMo</e2>.” Targeting users in Germany at this time, TrickMo is the latest variation in the transaction authentication number (TAN)-stealing malware category.
In-depth analysis of a <e1>Cerberus</e1> trojan variant <e2>Android</e2> banking trojans are nothing new, and Cerberus is just the latest in a long line of such malware to hit the headlines.

The new banking trojan can target over three hundred <e2>banking and mobile apps</e2>. “The story of ERMAC shows one more time how malware source code leaks can lead not only to slow evaporation of the malware family but also bring new threats/actors to the threat landscape.
<e1>Mandrake</e1> Spyware Now Targeting Android Users in Australia The spyware is capable of exploiting Google Chrome, Gmail, ANZ Australia, Bank of Melbourne Mobile Banking, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Bank of SA, Australian Super, and PayPal apps. The threat actors behind the campaign have leveraged the rise in the usage of mobile banking in <e2>Australia</e2> to target individuals.
, has actively targeted institutions globally, including Australia, <e2>France,</e2> Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the UK & the US. Researchers think <e1>Alien</e1> is a “fork” of the infamous Cerberus banking malware, which has had a steady reduction in use over the last year.
Malicious APK Like its previous versions, <e1>XLoader</e1> 6.0 abuses social media user profiles to hide its real C&C addresses, but this time its threat actors chose the social media platform Twitter, which was never used in previous attacks. The real C&C address is encoded in the <e2>Twitter</e2> names, and can only be revealed once decoded.
Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group <e2>APT-C-23</e2>, also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to public records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. <e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities. Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering. Disguised Spyware Uploaded on Google Play Store We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded. While details would vary, all of the identified copies of this spyware shared a similar disguise. In most cases they would be crafted to appear as applications distributed by unspecified mobile operators in <e2>Italy</e2>. Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page.
An Android malware called <e1>TangleBot</e1> has weaved its way onto the cyber-scene: One that researchers said can perform a bouquet of malicious actions, including stealing personal info and controlling apps and device functions. According to Cloudmark researchers, the newly discovered mobile malware is spreading via SMS messaging in the U.S. and <e2>Canada</e2>, using lures about COVID-19 boosters and regulations.
All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The <e1>FakeSpy</e1> malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo. Chunghwa Post - The government-owned corporation Chunghwa is the official postal service of Taiwan. Swiss Post - The national postal service of <e2>Switzerland</e2>, a fully state-owned limited company (AG) regulated by public law.
EXODUS ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by Italian app maker Connexxa, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. <e1>Exodus</e1> came to light when last month security researchers from Security Without Borders found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the <e2>Play Store</e2>, targeted at the customers of a local Italian internet service provider (ISP).
Dubbed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> (Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both Android and <e2>Flash Player</e2>. Once a user downloads one of these malicious apps into their devices and opens it, a popup overlay will appear prompting the user to enter their login credentials.
A tragedy in three acts <e1>Mandrake</e1>'s first stage, the "dropper," comes in the form of benign-looking apps that actually do what they promise. Bitdefender found several of those in Google Play under the names CoinCast, Currency XE Converter, Car News, Horoskope, SnapTune Vid, Abfix and Office Scanner. All have now been removed from Google Play, although Tom's Guide was able to confirm that Facebook and YouTube pages advertising some of them were still up. If you install one of these innocent-looking apps, it collects information about your device and your surroundings, but otherwise does nothing terrible. If the app didn't work well for its advertised purposes and you complained about it on <e2>Google Play</e2>, the malware operators would apologize and make improvements.
According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising <e1>Pegasus</e1> as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and <e2>iCloud</e2> from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history.
A cybersecurity research team has uncovered the “Mandrake” spying operation targeting Australian mobile banking users. <e1>Mandrake</e1> was first discovered earlier this year but is believed to be active since at least four years as a highly sophisticated spying platform. The threat actors behind the campaign have leveraged the rise in the usage of mobile banking in Australia to target individuals. One unusual factor observed by the researchers was that the attacks are manually orchestrated. By analyzing their captured data, the research team could identify 500 victims from <e2>Australia</e2> so far.

<e1>FakeSpy</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the Roaming Mantis threat group infect Android users with the FakeSpy infostealer.
The newer version of <e1>FakeSpy</e1> uses new URL addresses for malicious communication with FakeSpy. The function main uses a DES encryption algorithm to encode these addresses. The examples below show the plaintext key “TEST” to decrypt encoded hexadecimal strings (jUtils.decrypt()). These encoded strings contain the new URL addresses not seen in older versions of FakeSpy. WHO IS BEHIND FAKESPY’S SMISHING CAMPAIGNS? The Cybereason Nocturnus team suspects that the malware operators and authors are Chinese speakers. Our findings, along with previous research, indicates that the threat actor behind these recent campaigns is likely a Chinese group dubbed “Roaming Mantis”. <e2>Roaming Mantis</e2> is believed to be a Chinese threat actor group first discovered in April 2018 that has continuously evolved.

The modern version of <e2>Rotexy</e2> combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware. It spreads under the name AvitoPay.apk (or similar) and downloads from websites with names like <e1>youla9d6h.tk,</e1> prodam8n9.
The app was connected to a command-and-control server (C2), which issued a new command to download the additional malicious Android Application Package (APK), Cerberus. <e1>Cerberus</e1> has various spying and credential-theft functionalities. It can sit over an existing banking app and wait for the user to log into their bank account. Then, it creates a layover over the victims’ login screen, and steals their banking credentials. In addition, the trojan has the ability to access victims’ text messages, meaning that it can view two-factor authentication (2FA) codes sent via message. “It uses Android’s accessibility function, as well as the overlay attack mechanism, which is typical for banking trojans, so when a user opens their regular <e2>banking app</e2>, an overlay screen is created, and the user’s login details collected,” David told Threatpost.

As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files. The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data. However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio. The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration. Here is a command and control protocol fragment: In total, the malicious APK handles 16 different commands: Command Endpoint Description 1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message 2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number 3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version 4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications 5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date) 6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date) 7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure 8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds 1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs 2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages 3 reqcalllog.php Upload specified file from the device to the C2 4 reqcalllog.php Download file from specified URL and save on device 5 <e1>reqcalllog.php</e1> Delete specified file 6,7,8 reqcalllog.

Pegasus For Android: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, Lookout and Google are releasing research into the <e2>Android</e2> version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: <e1>Pegasus</e1>. A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets.
A new variant of Cerberus banking trojan, called <e1>Alien</e1>, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America & <e2>Microsoft Outlook</e2>. The newly uncovered banking Alien trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials!
[CLS] USPS is the most well-known branch of the <e1>US government</e1> and provides a publicly funded postal service. <e2>Royal Mail</e2> - British postal service and courier company. [SEP]
[CLS] Lookout notified <e1>Google</e1> of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in <e2>Palestine</e2> and has also been highlighted by other researchers. [SEP]
[CLS] Hamas-linked spyware targeting Palestinians removed from Google Play store A hacking group which analysts believe is linked to <e1>Hamas</e1> successfully placed highly targeted surveillanceware in the Google Play Store in order to spy on Palestinian targets, according to new research from the mobile security firm Lookout. The newly identified malware, known as Desert Scorpion, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in Palestine. A similar 2017 campaign from the same “highly active” group, dubbed APT-C-23. The group has been linked to Hamas’s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students. Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and <e2>ThreatConnect</e2> identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt.

[CLS] On February 14 2019 for the first time an Anubis sample seen targeting Russian banks only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator). On <e2>February 25 2019</e2> some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot Bubabot <e1>Neobot</e1> Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape. [SEP]
[CLS] The good news, according to security researchers from cyber-security firm Lookout, is that the iOS version is less sophisticated than the Android variant and has not yet been distributed via the official Apple App Store. <e1>EXODUS</e1> ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by Italian app maker Connexxa, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from Security Without Borders found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local Italian internet service provider (ISP). They said the spyware was capable of rooting Android devices and possessed an advanced set of spying features that gave attackers full control of infected devices. Security Without Borders said it detected nearly 25 different Exodus-infected apps that had been uploaded on the Play Store over the last two years. LESS-SOPHISTICATED EXODUS IOS VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit conference, the team at Lookout said it discovered an iOS variant of this spyware during their analysis of Exodus samples they've found last year. "Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port," Lookout security researcher Adam Bauer said in a report published today. Bauer said the iOS version was being offered for download through phishing sites that imitated Italian and <e2>Turkmenistani</e2> mobile carriers. [SEP]
[CLS] A third stage would attempt to let Exodus gain root control over an infected phone, typically though the use of an exploit dubbed <e2>DirtyCOW</e2>. Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the <e1>Facebook</e1> app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.

[CLS] Who has been using Pegasus and why <e1>NSO Group</e1> says it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the Mexican government in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. However, much of the recent reporting about Pegasus centers around a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The list has been attributed to NSO Group, but the list’s origins are unclear. A statement from <e2>Amnesty International</e2> in Israel stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients, though it’s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. [SEP]
[CLS] Similar to previous malware which infiltrated Google Play, such as FalseGuide and <e2>Skinner</e2>, Judy relies on the communication with its Command and Control server (C&C) for its operation. After Check Point notified Google about this threat, the apps were swiftly removed from the Play store. How Judy operates: To bypass Bouncer, Google Play’s protection, the hackers create a seemingly benign bridgehead app, meant to establish connection to the victim’s device, and insert it into the app store. Once a user downloads a malicious app, it silently registers receivers which establish a connection with the C&C server. The server replies with the actual malicious payload, which includes JavaScript code, a user-agent string and URLs controlled by the malware author. The malware opens the URLs using the user agent that imitates a PC browser in a hidden webpage and receives a redirection to another website. Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure. Upon clicking the ads, the malware author receives payment from the website developer, which pays for the illegitimate clicks and traffic. The JavaScript code locates the targeted ads by searching for iframes which contain ads from Google ads infrastructure, as shown in the image below: The fraudulent clicks generate a large revenue for the perpetrators, especially since the malware reached a presumably wide spread. Who is behind Judy? The malicious apps are all developed by a Korean company named <e1>Kiniwini</e1>, registered on Google Play as ENISTUDIO corp. [SEP]

[CLS] <e1>Hacking Team</e1> Spying Tool Listens to Calls Following news that iOS devices are at risk of spyware related to the Hacking Team, the saga continues into the Android sphere. We found that among the leaked files is the code for Hacking Team’s open-source malware suite RCSAndroid (Remote Control System Android), which was sold by the company as a tool for monitoring targets. (Researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014.) The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations. Based on the leaked code, the RCSAndroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including <e2>Skype</e2>, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

[CLS] According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to <e2>Israeli</e2> citizens.

[CLS] Called “DEFENSOR ID”, the banking trojan was available on <e2>Google Play</e2> at the time of the analysis. The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however, this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable Android’s Accessibility Service – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality. The DEFENSOR ID app made it onto the heavily guarded Google Play store thanks to its extreme stealth. Its creators reduced the app’s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious functionalities but one: abusing Accessibility Service. Accessibility Service is long known to be the Achilles’ heel of the Android operating system. Security solutions can detect it in countless combinations with other suspicious permissions and functions, or malicious functionalities – but when faced with no additional functionality nor permission, all failed to trigger any alarm on DEFENSOR ID. By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). DEFENSOR ID was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on Google Play. The developer name used, <e1>GAS Brazil</e1>, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users. [SEP]
[CLS] XLoader: A deep insight into the <e2>Android</e2> malware’s various campaigns XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps. Researchers note that XLoader has been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called the Yanbian Gang. XLoader is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps. The malicious apps collect device owners’ personal information and financial information. XLoader distributed via DNS domains XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps. These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices. Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges. After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

[CLS] <e2>Judy</e2> malware may have infected 36 million Android devices. Here's how to protect yourself Android malware spread by around 50 apps in the Google Play Store may have infected up to 36 million devices, security researchers at Checkpoint have warned. Dubbed Judy, due to many of the apps containing a character of the same name, the malicious code was installed when the applications were downloaded. Researchers at Checkpoint spotted the malware and say it was hosted on apps created by Korean developers Kiniwini, registered as ENISTUDIO Corp. These included Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, Judy’s Happy House, and Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess. The Israeli firm says the Judy malware is "an auto-clicking adware" that makes money for its creators by falsifying clicks on online adverts. It adds that the malware is "definitely an illegitimate use of the users' mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks". Since the existence of Judy has been publicly disclosed, Google has removed all affected apps from the Play Store. During this sweep, Judy was found on 41 apps from <e1>Kiniwinia</e1> and nine apps from other creators in total. [SEP]
[CLS] Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group APT-C-23, also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram. The malware, Android/SpyC32.A, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in 2017 by several security research teams. Meanwhile, the updated version, Android/SpyC23.A, has been in the wild since <e2>May 2019</e2> and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. [SEP]
[CLS] Report: NSO Group's Pegasus Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server <e2>Israeli</e2> spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday. According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and <e1>Apple</e1> noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers. [SEP]
[CLS] signal) <e2>ProtonMail</e2> (ch.protonmail.protonmail) The inclusion of these apps suggests they are being more commonly used by the Uyghur community than before. In particular, the inclusion of Signal and ProtonMail may suggest that the Uyghurs are aware of potential monitoring of their communications and are attempting to use applications with strong security features to avoid this. It is also worth noting that this implant also targets the popular messaging app WeChat. This app is referenced as "com.tencent.xin" in other write-ups, but it is not mentioned as WeChat. Volexity also noted that the malware has no mechanism for persistence. This indicates that the attackers must work quickly to obtain data that they want from a device before it reboots, or that they may potentially rely on the ability to reinfect a phone. Alternatively, it may be possible the attackers have a method to maintain persistence but only set this up manually after verifying the target. Conclusion Even though the vulnerabilities exploited in this report are patched as of July 2019 with iOS version 12.4 and newer, it appears that <e1>Evil Eye</e1> is likely having success with these attacks.

[CLS] Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that Ginp malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of Turkish banks, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in Poland and the <e2>United Kingdom</e2>. Specifically, our team discovered new Ginp overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing on the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2). These overlay pages are spoofs of legitimate banking pages, meant to deceive mobile device users into sharing confidential banking and other information. Several of these fake overlays mimic <e1>banks</e1> in Turkey, suggesting that malware operators intend to use these pages in future campaigns to target customers of Turkish banks. [SEP]
[CLS] The UAE did not immediately respond to a <e2>Post</e2> request for comment. One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed Pegasus, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told <e1>The Post</e1> that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. [SEP]
[CLS] Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich. Rather, it was downloaded later when the user was interacting with the app. With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. Andrew Blaich, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while ViperRAT apps had about a thousand combined installs. What those may seem like a low numbers, Blaich said Desert Scorpion "is a part of a targeted attack and not used for broad global-wide surveillance," and that "this number is in line with what we would expect." After Lookout reached out, Google removed the apps from the app store. "When we were notified by Lookout, we removed the apps from <e2>Play</e2> and updated Play Protect to help ensure users are secured," said a Google spokesperson. [SEP]

[CLS] A statement from <e1>Amnesty International</e1> in Israel stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients, though it’s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. A media consortium, the Pegasus Project, analyzed the phone numbers on the list and identified over 1,000 people in over 50 countries. The findings included people who appear to fall outside of the NSO Group’s restriction to investigations of criminal and terrorist activity. These include politicians, government workers, journalists, human rights activists, business executives and Arab royal family members. Other ways your phone can be tracked Pegasus is breathtaking in its stealth and its seeming ability to take complete control of someone’s phone, but it’s not the only way people can be spied on through their phones. Some of the ways phones can aid surveillance and undermine privacy include location tracking, eavesdropping, malware and collecting data from sensors.

[CLS] We named the malware <e1>Skygofree</e1>, because we found the word in one of the domains*. Malware Features Android According to the observed samples and their signatures, early versions of this Android malware were developed by the end of 2014 and the campaign has remained active ever since. The code and functionality have changed numerous times; from simple unobfuscated malware at the beginning to sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device. We have examined all the detected versions, including the latest one that is signed by a certificate valid from <e2>September 14, 2017</e2>. The implant provides the ability to grab a lot of exfiltrated data, like call records, text messages, geolocation, surrounding audio, calendar events, and other memory information stored on the device. [SEP]
[CLS] By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the <e1>Anubis</e1> trojan source code. Evolving capabilities With the operators’ plan to spread the trojan to Turkey, the following capabilities are worth a mention: Notifications blockers service RAT capabilities Injections locker How to stay safe? Download apps only from the Google Play Store. Do not click on suspicious links. Do not give the Accessibility permission to just any app, except for <e2>antivirus apps</e2>. [SEP]
[CLS] The app is installed on the phone and it then contacts the server to download a loader, which then provides the additional capabilities <e1>Mandrake</e1> needs to take control of the device. "The malware operates in stages, with the first stage being a benign app with no malicious behaviour, other than the ability to download and install a second-stage payload when expressly directed to do so. It is safe to say that its operator won't trigger this malicious behaviour while running in Google's analysis environment," Botezatu explained. The malware tricks the user into providing it with additional privileges on the device. "What seems to be a simple process such as going through an End-User License Agreement and accepting it is actually translated behind the scenes into requesting and granting extremely powerful permissions. With those permissions, the malware gets complete control of the device and data on it," said Botezatu. SEE: This new Android mobile malware targets banks, financial services across Europe While it's still uncertain who is exactly targeted by Mandrake and why, the attackers are aware that if they push the boat out too far, their campaign will be more likely to be discovered. We don't know who runs the cyber-criminal operation behind Mandrake, but the malware will specifically avoid running on devices in former Soviet Union countries, Africa and the Middle East. Researchers note that some of the first countries made exempt from Mandrake attacks were Ukraine, <e2>Belarus</e2>, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. [SEP]
[CLS] The coup de grâce is a command built into the malware called "<e1>seppuku</e1>," named after a form of Japanese ritual suicide. That command would factory-wipe the device, erasing all trace of the malware as well as all user data. Because you were tricked into granted Mandrake administrative privileges, rebooting the device or uninstalling the first-stage app won't get rid of the core malware. "The only way to remove Mandrake is to boot the device in safe mode, remove the device administrator special permission and uninstall it manually," Bitdefender wrote. Because that's where the money is Advertisement Such sophisticated abilities, and such targeted attacks, are normally the sure signs of a state-controlled espionage operation. But the Bitdefender researchers think this was a purely criminal-controlled money grab, even if the operators do appear to be located in Russia. Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, Mandrake won't infect Android users in Russia or former <e2>Soviet republics</e2>. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. [SEP]
[CLS] In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. <e2>Apple</e2> rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of National Security Agency hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. Governments and companies such as the NSO Group that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there’s no guarantee others won’t discover the same problems, some say. “Government use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,” said Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. “It's not like terrorists are using different phones from the rest of us.” Apple devices have long had a reputation for security, according to Forrester Research principal analyst Jeff Pollard — one highlighted earlier this year when the company faced down the <e1>FBI</e1> in a legal battle over an encrypted iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif.

[CLS] According to <e2>BleepingComputer</e2>, the latest version of Anubis targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a keylogger login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device. The newest Anubis acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the fake Orange app is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, <e1>U.S. Bank</e1>, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust, and Wells Fargo.

[CLS] Origins: It all started with <e1>BankBot</e1> In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting <e2>German banks</e2> at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] SpyNote RAT builder The <e1>SpyNote</e1> Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness. What we found were several other fake apps developed using the SpyNote builder, which should come as a warning to Android users. Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV Hotstar Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come. Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same SpyNote Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild. A complete list of sample hashes is available here. Conclusion The days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone. Nowadays, script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc. Moreover, there are many toolkits like the SpyNote Trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few clicks.

[CLS] Lookout Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> in the Google Play Store. Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running <e2>Facebook</e2> profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play.

The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program.

[CLS] This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available <e1>BankBot</e1> code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia. Interestingly, those locations match banking malware’s “usual suspects”; many of the previously observed banking malware families have been seen primarily targeting <e2>financial institutions</e2> in those subregions.

The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious Ryuk ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials. Abusing Android's Accessibility Features to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the <e1>CERT-Bund</e1> last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices.

[CLS] Over 17,000 new samples of the <e1>Anubis</e1> Android banking malware have been discovered in the wild which are targeting a total of 188 finance and banking applications. The attacker behind the development of Anubis has been active for at least 12 years, and in order to stay current, has retooled the malware for use in fresh attack waves, Trend Micro researchers said on Monday. The Anubis banking Trojan is often found in social engineering and phishing campaigns, in which unwitting victims are lured to download malicious apps containing the malware. In total, 17,490 new samples of the malware have been found on two related servers by Trend Micro. Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and <e2>Google</e2> short links to send remote commands to the malware. [SEP]

[CLS] According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement.

[CLS] The Trojan, found by <e2>Palo Alto Networks</e2>’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. Droidjack made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. OmniRat is similar in function and was first spotted in Germany in November by researchers who said targeted victims received a text message asking them to download an app to view an image. Once installed, SpyNote is hard to get rid of; it removes the SpyNote application icon from the victim’s phone and install new APKs and update the malware. “The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card,” according to a technical description of malware. <e1>Palo Alto</e1> has gleaned important details of SpyNote from what it identifies as a video demonstrating the capabilities of the malware.

It requests permission to access the additional storage. Project Spy’s earlier versions Searching for the domain in our sample database, we found that the coronavirus update app appears to be the latest version of another sample that we detected in May 2019. The first version of Project Spy (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_SpyAgent.HRXB) had the following capabilities: Collect device and system information (i.e., IMEI, device ID, manufacturer, model and phone number), location information, contacts stored, and call logs Collect and send SMS Take pictures via the camera Upload recorded MP4 files Monitor calls Searching further, we also found another sample that could be the second version of Project Spy. This version appeared as Wabi Music, and copied a popular video-sharing social networking service as its backend login page.

[CLS] " "Even though they know I am android malware analyst," Stefanko told me, "they tried to sell me their <e1>Cerberus</e1> bot. They created a profile where the only thing I needed to do is buy it. However my goal was to obtain working sample and C&C address to properly analyze it." The developers sent Stefanko a sample of Cerberus, but used his Twitter handle "instead of a real C&C server," and so he was unable to test it. Two days later, Stefanko and colleagues "detected an active campaign using this new banking Trojan with thousands of website visits that contained the payload. Cerberus was spread via a fake website that asked users to install Adobe Flash Player." Stefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used "a web framework where anyone can check website visit statistics—because of that I found out which countries are targeted with actual number of site visits." Over a fourteen day period, Stefanko tracked more than 13,000 visits to the fake Cerberus website, most of which were from users in the U.S. and Japan. At about the same time, Cerberus was seen being rented out in underground forums by the team at ThreatFabric. The malware's developers claimed it had been used privately for two years beforehand, and that it was "written from scratch" and does not "borrow" code from existing malware, making it harder to detect. There is certainly none of the leaked Anubis source code within Cerberus. "Rental of banking Trojans is not new," the researchers explain. "It was an existing business model when computer-based banking malware was the only form of banking malware and has shifted to the Android equivalent a few years later." Cerberus often comes as a social media attachment, so the usual caution on thinking before clicking applies. The malware uses its Flash Player application to trick user into granting accessibility rights. The malware can then grant itself additional rights to control the device, send messages, make calls, communicate back to its handlers. It can even disable <e2>Google Play Protect</e2> to avoid automatic detection. [SEP]

[CLS] The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the <e1>Pegasus</e1> installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.” The firm believes with “medium confidence” that Sneaky Kestrel acts on behalf of the UAE. It normally targets individuals inside the UAE, and one target hacked by the group previously received Pegasus links via SMS that “point to the same domain name used in the attacks on UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.” It’s also with medium confidence that the researchers assess that Monarchy acts on behalf of the <e2>Saudi government</e2>.

[CLS] Pegasus For Android: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, <e1>Lookout</e1> and Google are releasing research into the Android version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: Pegasus. A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets. Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, <e2>Mexico</e2>, Turkey, the UAE, and others. [SEP]
[CLS] If, for some reason, SuperService does not switch off the screen when there is an attempt to revoke the device administrator privileges, the Trojan tries to intimidate the user: While running, <e1>Rotexy</e1> tracks the following: switching on and rebooting of the phone; termination of its operation – in this case, it relaunches; sending of an SMS by the app – in this case, the phone is switched to silent mode. C&C communications The default C&C address is hardwired in the Rotexy code: The relative address to which the Trojan will send information from the device is generated in a pseudo-random manner. Depending on the Trojan version, dynamically generated subdomains can also be used. The Trojan stores information about C&C servers and the data harvested from the infected device in a local SQLite database. First off, the Trojan registers in the administration panel and receives the information it needs to operate from the C&C (the SMS interception templates and the text that will be displayed on HTML pages): Rotexy intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C. Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message. (It is specified in the interception template whether a reply must be sent, and which text should be sent to which address.) If the application hasn’t received instructions about the rules for processing incoming SMSs, it simply saves all SMSs to a local database and uploads them to the C&C. Apart from general information about the device, the Trojan sends a list of all the running processes and installed applications to the C&C. It’s possible the threat actors use this list to find running antivirus or <e2>banking applications</e2>. Rotexy will perform further actions after it receives the corresponding commands: START, STOP, RESTART — start, stop, restart SuperService. [SEP]
[CLS] The Gooligan hackers' escapades date back to at least June 2015, however, when the first evidence of the malware code was found. <e1>Check Point</e1> saw Android phones infected with malicious software containing early Gooligan code when physically connected to PCs running a Windows back-up tool, SnapPea. Whilst the attackers used multiple exploits and forced downloads on users' devices in last year's attacks, they hadn't pilfered Google account logins. After finding Gooligan in August, and noting its alarming success rate, Check Point and Google formed a task force to deal with the threat. Check Point today released a free tool to check for infection. In a blog post, it also provided a list of apps containing the malicious Gooligan code. Shaulov believes there's a good chance the community effort will lead to Gooligan's demise, though he wouldn't reveal the names of those he believed to be involved. "Hopefully we’ll be able to bring this operation to its end," he told me. "I’m not sure I can say exactly who it is but I can probably say who is involved." No user data theft, says Google It does not appear the hackers are actually using the account credentials to pilfer user data. Google's Android security chief, Adrian Ludwig, posted a blog about Gooligan today, saying the company had not seen any evidence of other fraudulent activity on the stolen accounts, outside of the promotion of apps. "The motivation behind Ghost Push is to promote apps, not steal information, and that held true for this variant," said Ludwig. All affected users have been notified and had their account login tokens reset. They've also been provided with clear guidelines on how to login securely, Ludwig added. Apps associated with Ghost Push activity have been removed from Google Play too. As Shaulov indicated, it appears a coordinated effort to take down the Ghost Push operation is well under way.

Such as, Ginp has traces of some of the codes of Anubis and the names of components of both the Trojans are also the same. The malware works by accessing the target device in the disguise of an authentic app. As soon as the malware gains access to the device, it hides the app icon and asks for Accessibility Service permissions. When the user grants permission, it automatically gets dynamic permissions. Using these permissions, the malware can send messages, make calls and perform overlay attacks easily without alerting the user. In June 2019, the Ginp malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, <e2>Bankia</e2>, BBVA, Caixa Bank, EVO Banco, Santander, and Kutxabank. [SEP]
[CLS] Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaws in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. "This is the most sophisticated bad actor we have ever seen targeting mobile phones out in the wild," said Mike Murray, vice president of security research at Lookout. The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. "We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits," the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. "The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes," the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in United Arab Emirates jails. Mansoor was almost immediately suspicious, he said. He has been jailed for his activism and targeted with commercial malware in past incidents that researchers have linked to the UAE government. “I’m a regular target for the authorities here,” he told <e2>The Post</e2>. “Every time they get new spyware, they seem to try it out on me.

In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster’s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. IBM X-Force reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. Malicious apps are a blight that both store operators and developers work hard to limit. Still, it is a recurring problem: In 2017, X-Force mobile researchers reported numerous occasions on which financial malware had sneaked into the Google Play Store, with the <e1>BankBot</e1> Android malware family leading the pack.

[CLS] The attacker behind the development of Anubis has been active for at least 12 years, and in order to stay current, has retooled the malware for use in fresh attack waves, <e2>Trend Micro</e2> researchers said on Monday. The Anubis banking Trojan is often found in social engineering and phishing campaigns, in which unwitting victims are lured to download malicious apps containing the malware. In total, 17,490 new samples of the malware have been found on two related servers by Trend Micro. Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and <e1>Google</e1> short links to send remote commands to the malware. [SEP]
[CLS] Attackers can: Open a <e2>backdoor</e2> into Android smartphones, to monitor and control them as they please; Send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, seriously increasing the victim’s phone bill; Read SMS messages, which means they can also read authentication codes sent as part of two-factor authentication mechanisms, used also by online banking apps and ecommerce websites; Use their full access to Android phones to basically manipulate the device to do whatever they want. And it gets worse. Polipo proxy and Man-in-the-Middle Attack The attackers behind Mazar BOT also implemented the “Polipo proxy“, which gives them additional access to even more Android functionalities. An even higher degree of compromise: Chrome injects As if it weren’t enough that it can stop calls and launch other aggressive commands on the victim’s phone, Mazar BOT is also capable of injecting itself into Chrome. And there are several other settings and commands that Mazar BOT can trigger, as showcased below. These include: Controlling the phone’s keys Enabling the sleep mode Save actions in the phone’s settings, etc. Mazar BOT won’t run on Russian Android smartphones Our team was not surprised to observe that the malware cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with the Russian language option. Mazar BOT will check the phone to identify the victim’s country and this will stop the malicious APK if the targeted phone turns out to be owned by a Russian user: locale.getCountry () equalsIgnoreCase ( “RU”)) Process.killProcess (Process.myPid ()); Until now, Mazar BOT has been advertised for sale on several websites on the Dark Web, but this is the first time we’ve seen this code be abused in active attacks. Attackers may be testing this new type of Android malware to see how they can improve their tactics and reach their final goals, which probably is making more money (as always). We can expect this malware to expand its reach, also because of its ability to remain covert by using <e1>TOR</e1> to hide its communication. [SEP]

On February 14 2019 for the first time an Anubis sample seen targeting Russian banks only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator). On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. <e1>Marcher</e1> In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis.

It mainly targets Chinese users, but has also successfully affected people and organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain, and Ireland. In addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, DualToy also performs the following activities on Android and iOS devices: Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly <e2>Riskware</e2> or Adware Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like AceDeceiver) Several years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to pair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy.

A spokesperson for the U.K.'s National Crime Agency confirmed to Newsweek that the arrests were made by officers from the national cybercrime unit and that a number of digital devices were seized from the property. The suspect has now been released on bail. DroidJack has a large potential victim base—there are reportedly more than one billion Android users across the world. Android recorded a market share of 82.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, almost six times the size of the user base of Apple's iOS mobile system. Newsweek spoke to Sean Sullivan, security adviser at international online security company F-Secure, about the malware and how Android users can protect themselves. What is DroidJack?

[CLS] Anubis II is the Android banking Trojan created and advertised by an actor with the nickname “<e1>maza-in</e1>”. This malware family goes beyond the well-known overlay attacks by combining advanced features such as screen streaming, remote file browsing, sound recording, keylogging and even a network proxy, making it an efficient banking malware but also a potential spying tool. Effectively, Anubis can be considered one of the most used Android banking Trojans since late 2017. As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as online banking credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a <e2>third-party app</e2> and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. [SEP]
[CLS] The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting <e2>Snapchat</e2> and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after banking app users. Trend Micro mobile threat analyst Tony Bao discovered a variant of Anubis (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_AnubisDropper) of the same type a few months ago.

[CLS] Ginp Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as <e1>AndroidOS_Ginp.HRXB</e1>) to steal user login credentials and credit card details. ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific <e2>banking apps</e2>. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. [SEP]

[CLS] Mobile <e1>Rotexy</e1> Malware Touts Ransomware, Banking Trojan Functions A mobile malware has accelerated its activity in 2018, launching more than 70k attacks in August through October. Mobile malware, dubbed Rotexy, has evolved from being spyware to now a dangerous banking trojan packing a host of new clever features. Researchers report 70,000 attacks between August and October with targets primarily based in Russia. In a technical brief released last week, researchers at Kaspersky Lab shed new light on the Rotexy malware, which was first spotted in October 2014 as an SMS spyware trojan. “The modern version of Rotexy combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware,” wrote Kaspersky Lab researchers Tatyana Shishkova and Lev Pikman. The latest version of the malware goes well beyond eavesdropping on SMS messages and has incorporated advanced device screen manipulation with the intent of stealing bank card numbers, as well carrying out ransomware attacks, they said. The Kaspersky analysis details four years of steady improvements to Rotexy. The trojan’s staple and unique feature has always been the use of a combination of three command-and-control sources which include conventional C&C servers, SMS messaging and utilizing the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform (where it sends small messages in JavaScript Object Notation format to a mobile device using Google servers). “This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of Rotexy and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives,” researchers said. Originally, the trojan was identified as Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but as it grew more sophisticated researchers assigned it to another family – Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy. Rotexy’s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of antivirus or <e2>banking applications</e2>).

[CLS] The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at <e2>Bitdefender</e2> that dubbed the malware Triout. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults.” Attackers aim to backdoor legitimate applications with an unusual injection technique dubbed Smali. The mobile malware also aims to inject legitimate mobile applications with a backdoor for persistent access once it has compromised an Android device. “To backdoor legitimate applications, attackers used a Smali injection technique – a type of injection that allows attackers to disassemble the code of original app with the Baksmali tool, add their malicious code, and assemble it with Smali.” reads the analysis published by Kaspersky. “As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files.” The ViceLeaker APK implements very common spyware features (exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs, and device information) along with backdoor capabilities (upload, download, delete files, camera takeover, and record surrounding audio). ViceLeaker leverages HTTP for C&C communications and to transfer exfiltrated data. During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “<e1>Conversations</e1>.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app. [SEP]

Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running <e2>Facebook</e2> profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play.

[CLS] For the purpose of this report we analyze here the Exodus One sample with hash 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 which communicated with the Command & Control server at <e1>54.71.249.137.</e1> Other samples communicated with other servers listed at the bottom of this report. Exodus One checks-in by sending a POST request containing the app package name, the device IMEI and an encrypted body containing additional device information. The encrypted body is composed of various identifiers which are joined together: doFinal() is called to encrypt the device information string: The user agent string is built from the package name and IMEI number: Finally the HTTP request is sent to the server at https://54.71.249.137/eddd0317-2bdc-4140-86cb-0e8d7047b874. Many of the strings in the application are XOR'd with the key Kjk1MmphFG: After some additional requests, the dropper made a POST request to https://54.71.249.137/56e087c9-fc56-49bb-bbd0-4fafc4acd6e1 which returned a zip file containing the second stage binaries. Stage 2: Exodus Two The Zip archive returned by the check-in performed by Exodus One is a collection of files including the primary payload mike.jar and several compiled utilities that serve different functions. At least in most recent versions, as of January 2019, the Zip archive would actually contain the i686, arm and arm64 versions of all deployed binaries. After download, Exodus One would dynamically load and execute the primary stage 2 payload mike.jar using the Android API DexClassLoader(). mike.jar implements most of the data collection and exfiltration capabilities of this spyware. Of the various binaries downloaded, the most interesting are null, which serves as a local and reverse shell, and rootdaemon, which takes care of privilege escalation and data acquisition. rootdaemon will first attempt to jailbreak the device using a modified version of the DirtyCow exploit. Similarly to another Android spyware made in Italy, originally discovered by Lukas Stefanko and later named <e2>Skygofree</e2> and analyzed in depth by Kaspersky Labs, Exodus also takes advantage of "protectedapps", a feature in Huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications.

[CLS] All the malicious <e2>Dvmap</e2> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name “start.” The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called “common”. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app “com.qualcmm.timeservices.” These archives contain the file “.root.sh” which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the “start” file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from <e1>libandroid_runtime.so.</e1> Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. [SEP]
[CLS] Dvmap: the first <e2>Android</e2> malware with code injection In April 2017 we started observing new rooting malware being distributed through the Google Play Store. Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries. Kaspersky Lab products detect it as Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a. The distribution of rooting malware through Google Play is not a new thing. For example, the <e1>Ztorg</e1> Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play almost 100 times since September 2016. [SEP]
[CLS] Lookout Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as <e2>Desert Scorpion</e2> in the Google Play Store. Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called <e1>APT-C-23</e1> targeting individuals in the Middle East. [SEP]
[CLS] We found traces of the Gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android <e2>app stores</e2>. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, <e1>MonkeyTest</e1>, and Xinyinhe. [SEP]
[CLS] The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone. <e1>Pegasus</e1> is designed to infiltrate devices running Android, Blackberry, iOS and Symbian operating systems and turn them into surveillance devices. The company says it sells Pegasus only to governments and only for the purposes of tracking criminals and terrorists. How it works Earlier version of Pegasus were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities in commonly used apps or by spear-phishing, which involves tricking a targeted user into clicking a link or opening a document that secretly installs the software. It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or manually if an agent can steal the target’s phone. Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone’s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/Flickr, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user’s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything. All that is required for a successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or operating system installed on the device. This is known as a zero-click exploit. Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and <e2>social media</e2> posts. [SEP]
[CLS] Figure 7 lists the IP addresses of these C2 servers, the number of <e1>RuMMS</e1> apps that connect to each of them, and the example URL used as the first parameter of the HttpPost operation (used in the code of Figure 3). This indicates that multiple C2 servers were used in this campaign, but one (37.1.207.31) was the most heavily used. Figure 8 shows how these samples, C2 servers and hosting websites are related to each other, including when they were compiled or observed. In the quadrant, the smaller boxes in blue-gray represent particular apps in the RuMMS family, while the bigger boxes in deep-blue represent C2 servers used by some RuMMS apps. The dotted arrows represent the use of a particular C2 server by a specific app to send information and fetch instructions. In this figure we have 11 RuMMS samples, all of which were hosted on the website as shown in the “y” axis. The dates on the “x” axis show the dates when we first saw these apps in the wild. This figure demonstrates the following interesting information: The time range when threat actors distributed RuMMS on those shared-hosting websites is from January 2016 to March 2016. Threat actors used different websites to host different payloads at different times. This kind of “moving target” behavior made it harder to track their actions. The same websites have hosted different RuMMS samples at different dates. C2 servers are shared by multiple samples. This matches our observations of C2 servers as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8. RuMMS samples, hosting sites, C2 servers from Jan. 2016 to Mar. 2016 We do not know exactly how many people have been infected with RuMMS malware; however, our data suggests that there are at least 2,729 infections with RuMMS samples from January 2016 to early April 2016. Figure 9 shows the number of RuMMS infections recorded in the last four months. When we first observed the malware in January, we recorded 380 infections. In February, we recorded 767 infections. In March, it peaked at 1,169 infections. In <e2>April</e2>, at the time of writing this post, we recorded 413 RuMMS infections. [SEP]
[CLS] He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. <e1>Ghost Push</e1> Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year. The initial warnings about Ghost Push landed in September last year, and Google said in April it was the most successful Android malware of 2015, infecting around 4 million phones in its various forms. It also rooted devices and displayed malicious ads. In October, security firm Cheetah Mobile Security said thredifferent versions of Ghost Push were propagating at a rate of 10,000 installs a day. The Gooligan hackers' escapades date back to at least June 2015, however, when the first evidence of the malware code was found. Check Point saw Android phones infected with malicious software containing early Gooligan code when physically connected to PCs running a Windows back-up tool, SnapPea. Whilst the attackers used multiple exploits and forced downloads on users' devices in last year's attacks, they hadn't pilfered Google account logins. After finding Gooligan in August, and noting its alarming success rate, Check Point and Google formed a task force to deal with the threat. Check Point today released a free tool to check for infection. In a blog post, it also provided a list of apps containing the malicious Gooligan code. Shaulov believes there's a good chance the community effort will lead to Gooligan's demise, though he wouldn't reveal the names of those he believed to be involved. "Hopefully we’ll be able to bring this operation to its end," he told me. "I’m not sure I can say exactly who it is but I can probably say who is involved." No user data theft, says Google It does not appear the hackers are actually using the account credentials to pilfer user data. Google's Android security chief, <e2>Adrian Ludwig</e2>, posted a blog about Gooligan today, saying the company had not seen any evidence of other fraudulent activity on the stolen accounts, outside of the promotion of apps.

[CLS] In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. <e1>Apple</e1> rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of National Security Agency hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. Governments and companies such as the NSO Group that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there’s no guarantee others won’t discover the same problems, some say. “Government use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,” said Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the <e2>American Civil Liberties Union</e2>. “It's not like terrorists are using different phones from the rest of us.

[CLS] Eventually, <e1>Google</e1> developers made several changes to the Android operating system that eliminated the threat from this attack vector. This prompted the hackers to start using other techniques to create the ransom note (e.g., abusing Android’s accessibility services), but they weren’t as effective. In October 2020, a new MalLocker.B variant appeared. It is the most evolved Android malware to date, according to the <e2>Microsoft</e2> researchers who found it. [SEP]

[CLS] On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On <e2>March 04 2019</e2>, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot <e1>Bubabot</e1> Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

[CLS] XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and <e1>FakeSpy</e1> have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.

[CLS] The so-called <e1>ViperRAT</e1> malware was incorporated into two apps, and it has previously targeted members of the Israeli Defense Force. Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker "a considerable amount of control over a compromised device." The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to <e2>Hamas</e2>, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. [SEP]
[CLS] SpyNote RAT Now Disguised As Netflix App A new version of the <e1>SpyNote</e1> Trojan is designed to trick Android users into thinking it’s a legitimate Netflix application. A new version of the SpyNote Trojan is designed to trick Android users into thinking it’s a legitimate Netflix application. Once installed, the remote access Trojan (RAT) essentially hands control of the device over to the hacker, enabling them to copy files, view contacts, and eavesdrop on the victim, among other capabilities. The malware is a new twist on the SpyNote RAT, a Trojan first uncovered on the dark web last summer by Palo Alto Networks. The most recent iteration, a product of the SpyNote Trojan builder, mimics a Netflix app and was discovered recently by researchers with Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ. Deepen Desai, Zscaler’s senior director of security research and operations, told <e2>Threatpost</e2> Tuesday that while researchers haven’t seen this particular RAT variant being spammed in the wild yet, they did see it on one of their threat feeds.

[CLS] The samples sharing this overlap are modified versions of an open source <e1>Jabber/XMPP</e1> client called “Conversations” with some code additions. The legitimate version of this app is also available on Google Play. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes. [SEP]
[CLS] cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, <e2>Israel</e2>, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after <e1>Lookout</e1> notified Google on April 3. [SEP]
[CLS] “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic <e2>Uzbekistan.”</e2> In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to <e1>Special Technology Center (STC)</e1>, a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U. [SEP]
[CLS] The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (<e1>asdfgjcr</e1>, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.) As of this writing, no files were hosted at any of the links. The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims. Use of a shared hosting service to distribute malware is highly flexible and low cost for the threat actors. It is also much harder for network defenders or researchers to track a campaign where the infrastructure is a moving target. Many top providers in Russia offer cheap prices for their shared hosting services, and some even provide free 30-day trial periods. Threat actors can register subdomains through the hosting provider and use the provider’s services for a short-period campaign. A few days later they can cancel the trial and do not need to pay a penny. In addition, these out-of-the-box hosting services usually provide better infrastructure than the attackers could manage to construct (or compromise) themselves. RuMMS Code Analysis All RuMMS samples share the same behaviors, major parts of which are shown in Figure 1. However, the underlying code can be quite different in that various obfuscation mechanisms were adopted to evade detection by anti-virus tools.

Kaspersky spotted a spyware campaign, tracked as ViceLeaker, that spreads in the Middle East to steal device and communications data from Android users. The ViceLeaker campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware <e2>Triout</e2>. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults. [SEP]
[CLS] Hacking Team’s <e2>RCS Android</e2>: The most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed “As each day passes and researchers find more and more source code in the huge Hacking Team data dump, it becomes more clear what the company’s customers could do with the spyware, and what capabilities other organized and commercial malware authors will soon be equipping their malicious wares with. After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on Google Play), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: RCS Android (<e1>Remote Control System Android</e1>).

[CLS] Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and <e1>Lookout</e1> alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of National Security Agency hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. Governments and companies such as the NSO Group that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there’s no guarantee others won’t discover the same problems, some say. “Government use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,” said Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. “It's not like terrorists are using different phones from the rest of us.” Apple devices have long had a reputation for security, according to <e2>Forrester Research</e2> principal analyst Jeff Pollard — one highlighted earlier this year when the company faced down the FBI in a legal battle over an encrypted iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif.

[CLS] In a previous campaign reported by <e2>JPCERT</e2>, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation.

[CLS] After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on <e2>Google Play</e2>), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: RCS Android (Remote Control System Android). Unsurprisingly, it can do so many things and spy on so many levels that they consider it the most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The spyware is delivered either via the aforementioned app, or via an SMS or email that contain a specially crafted URL that will trigger exploits for several vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean. This will allow the attacker to gain root privilege, and allow the installation of a shell backdoor and RCS Android. The RCS Android has two core modules: the Evidence Collector and the Event Action Trigger. The former is responsible for the spying routines: gathering device information, capturing screenshots and photos, recording speech by using the devices’ microphone, capturing voice calls, recording location, capturing Wi-Fi and online account passwords, collecting contacts and decoding messages from IM accounts, as well as collecting SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages. The latter is in charge of triggering malicious actions based on certain events (e.g. screen turning on, or SMS received with keywords). It can sync configuration data, upgrade modules, and download new payloads; upload the above mentioned collected data to the C&C server, and purge it from the device; execute shell commands; disable the network, root access; reset the device’s locking password; uninstall the bot. “To avoid detection and removal of the agent app in the device memory, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> suite also detects emulators or sandboxes, obfuscates code using DexGuard, uses ELF string obfuscator, and adjusts the OOM (out-of-memory) value,” the researchers shared.

[CLS] One representative sample <e1>Chrysaor</e1> app that we analyzed was tailored to devices running Jellybean (4.3) or earlier. The following is a review of scope and impact of the Chrysaor app named com.network.android tailored for a Samsung device target, with SHA256 digest: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox. If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable. Content observers: use Android's ContentObserver framework to gather changes in SMS, Calendar, Contacts, Cell info, Email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Kakao, <e2>Viber,</e2> and Skype. [SEP]

[CLS] SpyNote Trojan (RAT); Yet Another Bad News for Android Users <e2>SpyNote RAT</e2> was found leaked on a dark net forum — The researchers have warned about downloading Android apps from a third-party site to avoid this RAT infecting your device. Hackers love targeting Android devices due to its open source model and Google’s weak bouncer system that lets malicious apps pass by on the official Play Store. Recently, security researchers at Palo Alto’s Unit 42 discovered a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allow attackers to gain remote administrative control of an infected device. Dubbed Spynote by the researcher, the trojan targets those users who install apps in APK format, the process of downloading apps in APK format on Android devices is known as “sideloading” which is only possible if the user has allowed “Unknown Sources” in their security settings. The SpyNote RAT was found being discussed on several underground hacking forums by the researchers which, after analyzing turned out to be a bigger threat than expected. Upon scanning, it was discovered that SpyNote doesn’t require root access in order to take full control of an infected device. Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that’s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won’t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card. The researchers also found SpyNote’s sample scanned on VirusTotal. The Unit 42 also noted that <e1>SpyNot</e1> OmniRat and DroidJack. [SEP]

In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said.

[CLS] New Trojan <e1>SpyNote</e1> Installs Backdoor on Android Devices A new SpyNote Trojan can give bad guys control over your phone from the camera, microphone to eavesdropping on phone calls. A new Android Trojan called SpyNote has been identified by researchers who warn that attacks are forthcoming. The Trojan, found by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. Droidjack made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. OmniRat is similar in function and was first spotted in Germany in November by researchers who said targeted victims received a text message asking them to download an app to view an image. Once installed, SpyNote is hard to get rid of; it removes the SpyNote application icon from the victim’s phone and install new APKs and update the malware. “The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card,” according to a technical description of malware. <e2>Palo Alto</e2> has gleaned important details of SpyNote from what it identifies as a video demonstrating the capabilities of the malware.

[CLS] Google noted in its 2015 annual Android security report that a third of Android apps downloaded outside Google Play were infected with <e1>Ghost Push</e1>. The malware infected up to 600,000 Android devices per day during its peak. While details of the attack were released on Thursday, a major clean-up effort involving several Google teams, handset makers, hosting companies, ISPs, and research firms is already under way. Google has also revoked affected tokens and is using the Verify Apps on Android devices to block a list of Gooligan-infected apps, Ludwig said. While Gooligan doesn't directly harm end users, it comes at a price for legitimate Android developers who have a hard enough time being found among the two million apps now on Google Play. Google in October rolled out new detection and filtering in Google Play to combat fraudulently-installed apps and fake app reviews, which attempt to game Google's app-discovery algorithms. "These attempts not only violate the Google Play Developer Policy, but also harm our community of developers by hindering their chances of being discovered or recommended through our systems. Ultimately, they put the end users at risk of making wrong decisions based on inaccurate, unauthentic information," Google said at the time. Like Ghost Push, the Gooligan malware affects pre-Android 6.0 Marshmallow devices. However, the new variant also lays bare the security risks foisted on end users by Android's dysfunctional patching system, which leaves large swathes of over one billion handsets exposed to old bugs. According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. "Gooligan potentially affects devices on Android 4 Jelly Bean and KitKat, and 5 Lollipop, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today. About 57 percent of these devices are located in Asia and about nine percent are in <e2>Europe</e2>," Check Point said. [SEP]

[CLS] Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the <e1>Israeli Defense Force</e1> this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival <e2>Palestinian</e2> political party Fatah. [SEP]
[CLS] Google calls this threat <e1>Chrysaor</e1>, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android.

[CLS] Effectively, Anubis can be considered one of the most used Android banking Trojans since <e2>late 2017</e2>. As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as online banking credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e1>“Android.BankBot.149.origin”</e1>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. [SEP]
[CLS] The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to <e2>APT-C-27</e2>. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families. What it does The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The chat application acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app. At the time of writing Lookout has observed two updates to the <e1>Dardesh</e1> application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28.

[CLS] Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by <e2>DualToy</e2> on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like ZergHelper. It also has exactly the same behavior as <e1>AceDeceiver</e1>. When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to input his or her Apple ID and password,” Xiao wrote. [SEP]

[CLS] Evil Eye Threat Actor Resurfaces with iOS Exploit and Updated Implant In September 2019, Volexity published Digital Crackdown: Large-Scale Surveillance and Exploitation of Uyghurs, which described a series of attacks against Uyghurs from multiple <e1>Chinese APT actors.</e1> The most notable threat actor detailed in the blog was one Volexity calls Evil Eye. The Evil Eye threat actor was observed launching an exploit aimed at installing a malware implant on Android phones. Volexity also believed this was likely the same group responsible for the launching exploits aimed at installing an iOS implant as described by Google's Project Zero. Immediately after the publications from Google and Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor went fairly quiet. They removed their malicious code from compromised websites, command and control (C2) servers were taken down, and various hostnames stopped resolving. This largely remained the case until early January 2020, when Volexity observed a series of new activity across multiple previously compromised Uyghur websites. In the latest activity identified by Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor used an open source framework called IRONSQUIRREL to launch their exploit chain. The exploits used targeted Apple iOS operating systems leveraging a vulnerability in <e2>WebKit</e2> that appears to have been patched in the summer of 2019. [SEP]
[CLS] ” Sample Downloader Campaign From Current Analyses In the current campaign, according to <e2>X-Force</e2> researchers, the downloader apps target Turkish-speaking users. They differ in type and visual style — from online shopping to financial services and even an automotive app — and are designed to look legitimate and enticing to users. The variety of apps and styles indicates a large investment of resources on the part of the campaign’s operators, suggesting that a cybercrime service, rather than a single cybercrime faction, is likely responsible. The downloaders themselves are rather stealthy, and VirusTotal missed all but one of the samples. The one that was found had zero detections by antivirus engines. In this campaign, the malicious downloader apps X-Force detected have the same code base as three apps that <e1>ThreatFabric</e1> reported in January 2018. [SEP]
[CLS] Starting in June, our team discovered a number of new malware downloader samples that infect users with <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> (aka Go_P00t). The campaign features at least 10 malicious downloaders disguised as various applications, all of which fetch mobile banking Trojans that run on Android-based devices. While the number of downloaders may seem modest, each of those apps can fetch more than 1,000 samples from the criminal’s command-and-control (C&C) servers. Finding new downloaders in the app store in connection with the BankBot Anubis malware could suggest that: A given malware distributor/cybercrime faction has shifted from using Marcher to distributing BankBot Anubis; or The threat actors distributing the malware on Google Play are offering their “expertise” as a service, spreading malware downloaders for different cybercrime factions that use mobile Trojans to facilitate financial fraud — aka “downloader-as-a-service.” Such cybercrime services are common in the fraud and malware black markets. They entail a proven ability to infiltrate Google Play and plant malicious downloaders under the guise of benign-looking apps. These services can likely maintain the downloader’s C&C servers long enough to generate a steady stream of new infections, suggesting the thought-out operational security and know-how characteristic of organized cybercrime groups. An Era of Mobile Malware Downloaders As app store operators layer security to stymie the efforts of malicious developers, black-hat app distributors find ways to sidestep them. To circumvent ever-evolving app store defenses, mobile malware distributors rely on a strategy from the PC malware realms: Instead of uploading the actual malware to the store, which can result in sampling and detection at a very early stage in the distribution chain, they upload a downloader that may seem rather innocuous compared to actual malware. In general, a downloader app is more likely to survive security checks and recurring scans, and once it lands on a user’s device, it can fetch the intended malware app. As the <e2>Chinese</e2> general Sun Tzu wrote in “The Art of War,” “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.

[CLS] But new data published today by Citizen Lab researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the Pegasus spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, <e2>Canada</e2>, Switzerland, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place. Citizen Lab says ten of these 36 groups appear to be conducting surveillance in multiple countries and have not limited their spying inside their own country's borders, an act that may violate surveillance laws active in the states where Pegasus victims may be located. Citizen Lab researchers admitted that some of their findings may be inaccurate, as some targets may using VPN and satellite connections that may place their location in another country. But they also say this doesn't rule out that some Pegasus operators may be spying on dissidents living abroad, even in Western and well-developed countries where cross-border surveillance against their own citizens is strictly forbidden. In a statement provided to Citizen Lab researchers before the publication of today's report, an NSO Group spokesperson denied that the company was breaking any software export laws, adhering to the previously stated dogma that they're only selling Pegasus for crime-fighting purposes. "Contrary to statements made by [Citizen Lab], our product is licensed to government and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investigating and preventing crime and terror. Our business is conducted in strict compliance with applicable export control laws." To this statement, Citizen Lab responded with their own, pointing out that NSO Group, even after three years, continues to fail to see the reason the company is being heavily criticized online, and that's for selling Pegasus to oppressive regimes in the first place. "Citizen Lab research does not speak to what statements <e1>NSO</e1> may make during marketing, sales, or export compliance. [SEP]
[CLS] Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple <e2>Android 4 and 5</e2> exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware <e1>HummingBad</e1>.

[CLS] The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using <e1>Anubis</e1> in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and <e2>Australia</e2>. Interestingly, those locations match banking malware’s “usual suspects”; many of the previously observed banking malware families have been seen primarily targeting financial institutions in those subregions.

[CLS] According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. <e1>Anubis</e1> Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches BankBot Anubis from one of its C&C servers. The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called “Google Protect” and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android’s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user’s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user’s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user’s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible. These features are staples of PC banking malware and are evolving in Android malware as well. The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address Turkish users. With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany <e2>Hong Kong</e2> India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.

[CLS] The <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> app made it onto the heavily guarded Google Play store thanks to its extreme stealth. Its creators reduced the app’s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious functionalities but one: abusing Accessibility Service. Accessibility Service is long known to be the Achilles’ heel of the Android operating system. Security solutions can detect it in countless combinations with other suspicious permissions and functions, or malicious functionalities – but when faced with no additional functionality nor permission, all failed to trigger any alarm on DEFENSOR ID. By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). DEFENSOR ID was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on Google Play. The developer name used, GAS Brazil, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users. Apart from including the country’s name, the app’s name is probably intended to imply a relationship with the antifraud solution named GAS Tecnologia. That <e2>security software</e2> is commonly installed on computers in Brazil as several banks require it to log into their online banking. [SEP]

[CLS] Lookout notified <e2>Google</e2> of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The <e1>Lookout Threat Intelligence</e1> team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27.

[CLS] Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The <e1>Chinese cybercriminals</e1> behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year. The initial warnings about Ghost Push landed in September last year, and Google said in April it was the most successful Android malware of 2015, infecting around 4 million phones in its various forms. It also rooted devices and displayed malicious ads. In October, security firm <e2>Cheetah Mobile Security</e2> said thredifferent versions of Ghost Push were propagating at a rate of 10,000 installs a day. [SEP]

[CLS] During March 2019, actor <e2>Aldesa</e2> (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff <e1>DiseaseBot</e1> Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

[CLS] Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based <e1>Al Araby TV</e1>. “Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,” according to Citizen Lab. KISMET likely doesn’t work against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections, Citizen Labs noted. Apple meanwhile is looking into the issue. Inside One Victim’s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, France, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, <e2>Choopa</e2>, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]
[CLS] <e2>ViceLeaker</e2> Android spyware targets users in the Middle East Experts at Kaspersky have uncovered a spyware campaign dubbed ViceLeaker that spreads in the Middle East to spy on Android users. Kaspersky spotted a spyware campaign, tracked as ViceLeaker, that spreads in the Middle East to steal device and communications data from Android users. The ViceLeaker campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware <e1>Triout</e1>. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults. [SEP]

[CLS] private equity firm <e2>Francisco Partners</e2> in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. "We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits," the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. "The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes," the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in United Arab Emirates jails. Mansoor was almost immediately suspicious, he said. He has been jailed for his activism and targeted with commercial malware in past incidents that researchers have linked to the UAE government. “I’m a regular target for the authorities here,” he told The Post. “Every time they get new spyware, they seem to try it out on me.” So instead of clicking the links in the text messages, he sent them to researchers at Citizen Lab. Working with Lookout, they confirmed his fears: Mansoor’s attackers would have been able to essentially take over his phone if he'd clicked. The UAE did not immediately respond to a Post request for comment. One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.

[CLS] Android Spyware Monokle, developed by Russian defense contractor, used in targeted attacks Researchers at Lookout discovered a new mobile spyware dubbed Monokle that was developed by a <e1>Russian defense contractor</e1>. “Lookout has discovered a highly targeted mobile malware threat that uses a new and sophisticated set of custom Android surveillanceware tools called Monokle that has possible connections to Russian threat actors.” reads the report published by Lookout. “Lookout research indicates these tools are part of a targeted set of campaigns and are developed by the St. Petersburg, Russia-based company, Special Technology Centre, Ltd. (STC, Ltd. or STC).” Special Technology Centre Ltd. (STC) has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. Monokle supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, <e2>Skype</e2>, and Snapchat.

[CLS] FakeSpy Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> threat group infect Android users with the FakeSpy infostealer. Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the <e2>United States</e2>. The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the Android recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing. [SEP]
[CLS] In a previous campaign reported by <e2>JPCERT</e2>, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and <e1>Transportation Services Companies</e1> One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world.

[CLS] Cybereason's investigation shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy campaign is a Chinese-speaking group dubbed "<e1>Roaming Mantis</e1>", a group that has led similar campaigns. FakeSpy has been in the wild since 2017; this latest campaign indicates that it has become more powerful. Code improvements, new capabilities, anti-emulation techniques, and new, global targets all suggest that this malware is well-maintained by its authors and continues to evolve. INTRODUCTION For the past several weeks, Cybereason has been investigating a new version of Android malware dubbed FakeSpy, which was first identified in October 2017 and reported again in October 2018. A new campaign is up and running using newly improved, significantly more powerful malware as compared to previous versions. FakeSpy is under active development and is evolving rapidly; new versions are released every week with additional evasion techniques and capabilities. Our analysis shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy malware is a Chinese-speaking group, commonly referred to as "Roaming Mantis", a group that is known to have launched similar campaigns in the past. FakeSpy is an information stealer that exfiltrates and sends SMS messages, steals financial and application data, reads account information and contact lists, and more. The malware uses smishing, or SMS phishing, to infiltrate target devices, which is a technique that relies on social engineering. The attackers send fake text messages to lure the victims to click on a malicious link. The link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK). This most recent FakeSpy campaign appears to target users of <e2>postal services</e2> around the world. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Ginp</e1> mobile Trojan fakes incoming SMS messages Having infiltrated a phone, most mobile banking Trojans try to gain access to SMS messages. They do so to intercept one-time confirmation codes from banks. Armed with such a code, the malware owners can make a payment or siphon off funds without the victim noticing. At the same time, many mobile Trojans use text messages to infect more devices by sending the victim’s contacts a bad download link. Some malicious apps are more creative, using SMS access to distribute other things in your name, such as offensive text messages. The Ginp malware, which we first detected last fall, can even create incoming texts on the victim’s phone that no one actually sent — and not only texts. But let’s start from the beginning. What Ginp mobile Trojan is capable of? At first, Ginp had a fairly standard skill set for a banking Trojan. It sent all the victim’s contacts to its creators, intercepted text messages, stole bank card data, and overlaid <e2>banking apps</e2> with phishing windows. [SEP]

[CLS] The so-called <e2>ViperRAT</e2> malware was incorporated into two apps, and it has previously targeted members of the Israeli Defense Force. Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker "a considerable amount of control over a compromised device." The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1> suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. [SEP]
[CLS] Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries. <e2>Kaspersky Lab</e2> products detect it as Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a.

[CLS] Hamas-linked spyware targeting Palestinians removed from Google Play store A hacking group which analysts believe is linked to Hamas successfully placed highly targeted surveillanceware in the Google Play Store in order to spy on <e2>Palestinian</e2> targets, according to new research from the mobile security firm Lookout. The newly identified malware, known as Desert Scorpion, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in Palestine. A similar 2017 campaign from the same “highly active” group, dubbed APT-C-23. The group has been linked to Hamas’s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students. Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified <e1>Google</e1> on April 3. [SEP]
[CLS] Hacking Team’s <e1>RCS Android</e1>: The most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed “As each day passes and researchers find more and more source code in the huge Hacking Team data dump, it becomes more clear what the company’s customers could do with the spyware, and what capabilities other organized and commercial malware authors will soon be equipping their malicious wares with. After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on Google Play), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: RCS Android (Remote Control System Android). Unsurprisingly, it can do so many things and spy on so many levels that they consider it the most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The spyware is delivered either via the aforementioned app, or via an SMS or email that contain a specially crafted URL that will trigger exploits for several vulnerabilities in the <e2>default browsers</e2> of Android versions 4.

[CLS] SpyNote Trojan (RAT); Yet Another Bad News for Android Users <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> was found leaked on a dark net forum — The researchers have warned about downloading Android apps from a third-party site to avoid this RAT infecting your device. Hackers love targeting Android devices due to its open source model and <e2>Google</e2>’s weak bouncer system that lets malicious apps pass by on the official Play Store. [SEP]
[CLS] First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. <e2>Security Without Borders</e2> has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features. Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named Connexxa S.R.L. and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S. [SEP]
[CLS] Mandrake's "ritual suicide" <e1>Mandrake</e1> tricks you by putting fake overlays on your screen, such as an end-user license agreement that must be agreed to. Those are tailored to different phones, screen sizes, languages and versions of Android. But when you click "OK" to accept the agreement, you're really granting it administrative privileges. Then Mandrake forwards all your text messages to the attackers, forwards phone calls to other numbers, blocks calls, installs or remove apps, steals contact lists, hides notifications, records screen activity, steals passwords to your Facebook and online bank accounts, creates phishing pages to leech your credentials for Gmail and Amazon, and tracks your location. The coup de grâce is a command built into the malware called "seppuku," named after a form of Japanese ritual suicide. That command would factory-wipe the device, erasing all trace of the malware as well as all user data. Because you were tricked into granted Mandrake administrative privileges, rebooting the device or uninstalling the first-stage app won't get rid of the core malware. "The only way to remove Mandrake is to boot the device in safe mode, remove the device administrator special permission and uninstall it manually," Bitdefender wrote. Because that's where the money is Advertisement Such sophisticated abilities, and such targeted attacks, are normally the sure signs of a state-controlled espionage operation. But the Bitdefender researchers think this was a purely criminal-controlled money grab, even if the operators do appear to be located in Russia. Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, Mandrake won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. For unknown reasons, it also avoids installing itself on phones with <e2>Verizon</e2> SIM cards, or SIM cards from a top Chinese cellular carrier. [SEP]
[CLS] Customers of Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and <e1>Capital One</e1>, along with nearly 400 other financial institutions, are being targeted by a malicious app disguised to look like the official account management platform for French telecom company Orange S.A. Researchers say this is just the beginning. Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan Anubis – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at <e2>Lookout</e2> warned in a new report. [SEP]
[CLS] Michael Shaulov, head of mobile and cloud Security Check Point, said that might be a porn site, or a <e1>third-party app store</e1>, where visitors are encouraged to download software to get access to content. But once downloaded, Gooligan determines which Android phone it's infected and launches the appropriate exploits to "root" the device -- i.e. take complete control over it. To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as VROOT and <e2>Towelroot</e2>, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, KitKat and Lollipop. [SEP]
[CLS] Skygofree: Following in the footsteps of <e1>HackingTeam</e1> At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. We observed many web landing pages that mimic the sites of mobile operators and which are used to spread the Android implants. These domains have been registered by the attackers since 2015. According to our telemetry, that was the year the distribution campaign was at its most active. The activities continue: the most recently observed domain was registered on October 31, 2017. Based on our KSN statistics, there are several infected individuals, exclusively in <e2>Italy</e2>. Moreover, as we dived deeper into the investigation, we discovered several spyware tools for Windows that form an implant for exfiltrating sensitive data on a targeted machine. [SEP]
[CLS] The <e2>Conversations</e2> modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes. [SEP]
[CLS] “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. <e2>Kaspersky</e2> spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the U.S. reported the second largest attacks (17.17%) and Hong Kong stood third (4.81%). Earlier, Kaspersky uncovered AppleJeus, a malicious operation by North Korea’s cyber-hacking outfit ‘Lazarus Group’ to intrude on cryptocurrency exchanges and applications. According to an official report, Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (<e1>GReAT</e1>) discovered the unusual activity of attackers who penetrated the network of an Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange using Trojanized trading software to steal cryptocurrencies.

[CLS] , Belgium and <e2>Switzerland</e2>—as well as U.S. legal officials, carried out a number of property raids and arrests of suspected DroidJack users on Tuesday. On Friday, the BBC reported that British police had arrested a 28-year-old man from Carlisle, northern England, under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 in relation to the international investigation. A spokesperson for the U.K.'s National Crime Agency confirmed to Newsweek that the arrests were made by officers from the national cybercrime unit and that a number of digital devices were seized from the property. The suspect has now been released on bail. DroidJack has a large potential victim base—there are reportedly more than one billion Android users across the world. Android recorded a market share of 82.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, almost six times the size of the user base of Apple's iOS mobile system. Newsweek spoke to Sean Sullivan, security adviser at international online security company <e1>F-Secure</e1>, about the malware and how Android users can protect themselves. [SEP]

[CLS] Google noted in its 2015 annual Android security report that a third of Android apps downloaded outside Google Play were infected with <e1>Ghost Push</e1>. The malware infected up to 600,000 Android devices per day during its peak. While details of the attack were released on Thursday, a major clean-up effort involving several Google teams, handset makers, hosting companies, ISPs, and research firms is already under way. Google has also revoked affected tokens and is using the Verify Apps on Android devices to block a list of Gooligan-infected apps, Ludwig said. While Gooligan doesn't directly harm end users, it comes at a price for legitimate Android developers who have a hard enough time being found among the two million apps now on Google Play. Google in October rolled out new detection and filtering in Google Play to combat fraudulently-installed apps and fake app reviews, which attempt to game Google's app-discovery algorithms. "These attempts not only violate the Google Play Developer Policy, but also harm our community of developers by hindering their chances of being discovered or recommended through our systems. Ultimately, they put the end users at risk of making wrong decisions based on inaccurate, unauthentic information," Google said at the time. Like Ghost Push, the Gooligan malware affects pre-Android 6.0 Marshmallow devices. However, the new variant also lays bare the security risks foisted on end users by Android's dysfunctional patching system, which leaves large swathes of over one billion handsets exposed to old bugs. According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. "Gooligan potentially affects devices on Android 4 Jelly Bean and KitKat, and 5 <e2>Lollipop</e2>, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today. [SEP]
[CLS] This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available <e1>BankBot</e1> code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in <e2>Europe</e2>, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

[CLS] The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2> jails. Mansoor was almost immediately suspicious, he said. He has been jailed for his activism and targeted with commercial malware in past incidents that researchers have linked to the UAE government. “I’m a regular target for the authorities here,” he told The Post. “Every time they get new spyware, they seem to try it out on me.” So instead of clicking the links in the text messages, he sent them to researchers at Citizen Lab. Working with Lookout, they confirmed his fears: Mansoor’s attackers would have been able to essentially take over his phone if he'd clicked. The UAE did not immediately respond to a Post request for comment. One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.

[CLS] Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from Security Without Borders found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local <e1>Italian internet service provider (ISP)</e1>. They said the spyware was capable of rooting Android devices and possessed an advanced set of spying features that gave attackers full control of infected devices. Security Without Borders said it detected nearly 25 different Exodus-infected apps that had been uploaded on the Play Store over the last two years. LESS-SOPHISTICATED EXODUS IOS VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit conference, the team at <e2>Lookout</e2> said it discovered an iOS variant of this spyware during their analysis of Exodus samples they've found last year.

[CLS] “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… <e1>WireLurker</e1> installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e2>ZergHelper</e2>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]

[CLS] cybersecurity firms <e2>Palo Alto Networks</e2> and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “<e1>Fateh</e1>” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party.

Capture real-time voice calls in any network or app by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service RCSAndroid in the Wild Our analysis reveals that this RCSAndroid (AndroidOS_RCSAgent.HRX) has been in the wild since 2012. Traces of its previous uses in the wild were found inside the configuration file: It was configured to use a Command-and-control (C&C) server in the United States; however, the server was bought from a host service provider and is now unavailable. It was configured to activate via SMS sent from a Czech Republic number. Attackers can send SMS with certain messages to activate the agent and trigger corresponding action. This can also define what kind of evidences to collect. Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of Czech firms appear to be in business with the Hacking team, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email.

[CLS] We found traces of the <e1>Gooligan</e1> malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, MonkeyTest, and Xinyinhe. By late 2015, the malware’s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of <e2>2016</e2> when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes.

[CLS] Christoph Scholz/<e1>Flickr</e1>, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user’s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything. All that is required for a successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or operating system installed on the device. This is known as a zero-click exploit. Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts. It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance without the permission or knowledge of the user. Who has been using Pegasus and why NSO Group says it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the Mexican government in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered <e2>Saudi</e2> journalist Jamal Khashoggi. [SEP]

[CLS] Dubbed "Pegasus," the assault package leverages <e2>three zero-day vulnerabilities</e2> to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more. Apple patched the vulnerability last week when it released <e1>iOS 9.3.5</e1>.

[CLS] ” Just because surveillance features haven’t been seen before doesn’t mean the <e2>Android</e2> spyware is new. In fact, Kaspersky believes the malware was created at least by the end of 2014. Kaspersky discovered it in October 2017 and noted that one of the domains used to spread the spyware was registered by the attackers that same month. However, the domains hosting fake mobile operator sites were registered in 2015; that is the year Kaspersky said the distribution campaign was “most active” – it is also the year the Hacking Team was hacked. Italian company behind Skygofree Kaspersky didn’t go so far as to say which company is behind Skygofree, it is “pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like <e1>HackingTeam</e1>.” Various artifacts in the code referenced “negg;” Forbes’ sources claimed the Rome-based Negg is “working with the police now” to fill “the gap left behind by Hacking Team.

Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Like Anubis, <e1>EventBot</e1> is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. [SEP]

The Trojan, found by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. Droidjack made news earlier this month when researchers at <e2>Proofpoint</e2> found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. [SEP]

XLoader is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps. The malicious apps collect device owners’ personal information and financial information. XLoader distributed via DNS domains XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps. These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices. Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges. After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, <e2>China</e2>, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. [SEP]

[CLS] Cerberus: A New Android 'Banking Malware For Rent' Emerges August 13, 2019 After a few popular Android Trojans like Anubis, Red Alert 2.0, <e1>GM bot</e1>, and Exobot, quit their malware-as-a-service businesses, a new player has emerged on the Internet with similar capabilities to fill the gap, offering Android bot rental service to the masses. Dubbed "Cerberus," the new remote access Trojan allows remote attackers to take total control over the infected Android devices and also comes with banking Trojan capabilities like the use of overlay attacks, SMS control, and contact list harvesting. According to the author of this malware, who is surprisingly social on Twitter and mocks security researchers and antivirus industry openly, Cerberus has been coded from scratch and doesn't re-use any code from other existing banking Trojans. The author also claimed to be using the Trojan for private operations for at least two years before renting it out for anyone interested from the past two months at $2000 for 1 month usage, $7000 for 6 months and up to $12,000 for 12 months. Cerberus Banking Trojan: Features According to security researchers at ThreatFabric who analyzed a sample of Cerberus Trojan, the malware has a pretty common list of features, like: taking screenshots recording audio recording keylogs sending, receiving, and deleting SMSes, stealing contact lists forwarding calls collecting device information Tracking device location stealing account credentials, disabling <e2>Play</e2> Protect downloading additional apps and payloads removing apps from the infected device pushing notifications locking device's screen Once infected, Cerberus first hides its icon from the application drawer and then asks for the accessibility permission by masquerading itself as Flash Player Service.

Traces of its previous uses in the wild were found inside the configuration file: It was configured to use a Command-and-control (C&C) server in the United States; however, the server was bought from a host service provider and is now unavailable. It was configured to activate via SMS sent from a Czech Republic number. Attackers can send SMS with certain messages to activate the agent and trigger corresponding action. This can also define what kind of evidences to collect. Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of Czech firms appear to be in business with the <e1>Hacking team</e1>, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. [SEP]
[CLS] In this campaign, the malicious downloader apps X-Force detected have the same code base as three apps that ThreatFabric reported in <e2>January 2018</e2>. The following characteristics show the similarity: The resemblance is even more striking in the figure below. By removing all the key instances (**pE2**) from the string, we produced the same string from the January sample: With 10 downloaders at this point, the campaign appears to be scaling up. Over time, we’ve seen the code evolve. As time went by between downloader versions, the developers added a simple obfuscation and expanded the downloader capabilities. The code was also altered slightly to avoid detection by Google Play’s security controls. According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. Anubis Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> from one of its C&C servers. [SEP]
[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the <e1>Ahrar al-Sham</e1> militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called Ahrar Maps made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham. “There is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,” according to the report. “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.” In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to Special Technology Center (STC), a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the <e2>U.S.</e2> government under President Obama, for interfering in the 2016 presidential elections.

[CLS] “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… <e2>WireLurker</e2> installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like ZergHelper. It also has exactly the same behavior as <e1>AceDeceiver</e1>. When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to input his or her Apple ID and password,” Xiao wrote. [SEP]
[CLS] Figure 7 lists the IP addresses of these C2 servers, the number of <e1>RuMMS</e1> apps that connect to each of them, and the example URL used as the first parameter of the HttpPost operation (used in the code of Figure 3). This indicates that multiple C2 servers were used in this campaign, but one (37.1.207.31) was the most heavily used. Figure 8 shows how these samples, C2 servers and hosting websites are related to each other, including when they were compiled or observed. In the quadrant, the smaller boxes in blue-gray represent particular apps in the RuMMS family, while the bigger boxes in deep-blue represent C2 servers used by some RuMMS apps. The dotted arrows represent the use of a particular C2 server by a specific app to send information and fetch instructions. In this figure we have 11 RuMMS samples, all of which were hosted on the website as shown in the “y” axis. The dates on the “x” axis show the dates when we first saw these apps in the wild. This figure demonstrates the following interesting information: The time range when threat actors distributed RuMMS on those shared-hosting websites is from January 2016 to March 2016. Threat actors used different websites to host different payloads at different times. This kind of “moving target” behavior made it harder to track their actions. The same websites have hosted different RuMMS samples at different dates. C2 servers are shared by multiple samples. This matches our observations of C2 servers as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8. RuMMS samples, hosting sites, C2 servers from Jan. 2016 to Mar. 2016 We do not know exactly how many people have been infected with RuMMS malware; however, our data suggests that there are at least 2,729 infections with RuMMS samples from January 2016 to early April 2016. Figure 9 shows the number of RuMMS infections recorded in the last four months. When we first observed the malware in January, we recorded 380 infections. In <e2>February</e2>, we recorded 767 infections. [SEP]

[CLS] How do <e2>Android</e2> devices become infected? We found traces of the Gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, MonkeyTest, and <e1>Xinyinhe</e1>. By late 2015, the malware’s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes.

[CLS] Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff <e1>DiseaseBot</e1> Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape. The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for <e2>Android</e2> banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events.

[CLS] "Monokle is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software," Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told <e1>ZDNet</e1>. "It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device." While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (STC), a Russian company working out of <e2>St Petersburg</e2>. STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being "complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities" against the US. [SEP]
[CLS] Experts from threat intelligence firm <e2>SenseCy</e2> spotted a new piece of Android RAT, dubbed MobiHok RAT, that used code from the old SpyNote RAT. At the beginning of July 2019, the experts spotted a threat actor dubbed mobeebom that was offering for sale an Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT) dubbed MobiHok v4 on a prominent English hacking forum. The experts discovered that mobeebom is active on multiple Arab-speaking hacking forums under different pseudonyms, a circumstance that suggests that he is an Arab-speaker. Researchers also noticed that the posts published by the hacker were using poor English. mobeebom has been promoting the MobiHok RAT through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since January 2019. MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In July 2016, experts from <e1>Palo Alto Networks</e1> a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like OmniRat and DroidJack, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum.

[CLS] And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. <e1>Cerberus</e1> was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing Anubis’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the banking apps inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. Like any Remote Access Trojan worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside. Basically, Cerberus can intercept and steal your phone’s unlock pattern or PIN, as well as Google Authenticator numbers, and any SMS necessary to perform a two-step verification. Likewise, this malware can interpose itself between you and your bank’s app through an overlay, the most common method for carrying out a phishing attack. In short, Cerberus can enter your computer, extract all the necessary data to perform a bank fraud, and wait for the best moment to take the money from your account. All without you doing anything. Cerberus and its complex functionality Regarding what Cerberus can do, it is necessary to point out two possibilities within its functionality. We already mentioned that Cerberus is a RAT, but to achieve such control of the phone, it is necessary to have control of a vulnerability. In this case, it is the Android Accessibility Service. This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by Cerberus to give itself more permissions without user interaction. Having control of the Accessibility Services, the malware proceeds to ensure its persistence in different ways, either by disabling <e2>Play Protect</e2> or by removing itself from the applications in use.

[CLS] In a previous campaign reported by <e1>JPCERT</e1>, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company.

[CLS] According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. <e1>Anubis</e1> Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches BankBot Anubis from one of its C&C servers. The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called “Google Protect” and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android’s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user’s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user’s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user’s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible. These features are staples of PC banking malware and are evolving in Android malware as well. The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address Turkish users. With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland <e2>Slovakia</e2> Spain Taiwan Turkey U.

[CLS] Royal Mail, DHL Group, France's Las Poste, Taiwan's Chunghwa Post, several private delivery companies in Japan as well as others in Switzerland and Germany, <e2>Cybereason</e2> researchers say. If the recipient clicks on the links in these messages, malicious code is downloaded onto the Android device that installs the FakeSpy malware. The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday. FakeSpy has been active in the wild since at least 2017. Its operators have been refining the information stealer’s code over the last three years and adding capabilities, according to Cybereason. The latest version has a larger target list that includes the U.S. and Europe.

APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in 2017 by several security research teams. Meanwhile, the updated version, Android/SpyC23.A, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, <e2>Threema</e2> and Telegram. [SEP]
[CLS] However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, <e2>United Kingdom</e2>, United States, and others.

[CLS] For example, the <e1>Ztorg</e1> Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play almost 100 times since September 2016. But Dvmap is very special rooting malware. It uses a variety of new techniques, but the most interesting thing is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries – libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so. This makes Dvmap the first Android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime, and it has been downloaded from the Google Play Store more than 50,000 times. Kaspersky Lab reported the Trojan to Google, and it has now been removed from the store. To bypass Google Play Store security checks, the malware creators used a very interesting method: they uploaded a clean app to the store at the end of March, 2017, and would then update it with a malicious version for short period of time. Usually they would upload a clean version back on Google Play the very same day. They did this at least 5 times between 18 April and <e2>15 May</e2>. All the malicious Dvmap apps had the same functionality. [SEP]

[CLS] Its target set consists mostly of customers of <e2>Spanish banks</e2>; nevertheless, the operators are planning on evolving their strategies to propagate in Turkey. Know the history The initial version of the malware masqueraded as a Google Play Verificator app. In August 2019, a new variant was launched with banking-specific capabilities, disguised as fake Adobe Flash Player apps. The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with Viber and Snapchat. By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the <e1>Anubis</e1> trojan source code. [SEP]
[CLS] Security researchers discover iOS version of Exodus Android spyware Exodus iOS spyware used against Italian and <e2>Turkmenistan</e2> users. Security researchers have discovered the iOS counterpart of a dangerous Android spyware strain that was seen earlier this year on the official Google Play Store. The good news, according to security researchers from cyber-security firm Lookout, is that the iOS version is less sophisticated than the Android variant and has not yet been distributed via the official Apple App Store. EXODUS ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by Italian app maker Connexxa, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from <e1>Security Without Borders</e1> found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local Italian internet service provider (ISP).

[CLS] This figure demonstrates the following interesting information: The time range when threat actors distributed <e1>RuMMS</e1> on those shared-hosting websites is from January 2016 to March 2016. Threat actors used different websites to host different payloads at different times. This kind of “moving target” behavior made it harder to track their actions. The same websites have hosted different RuMMS samples at different dates. C2 servers are shared by multiple samples. This matches our observations of C2 servers as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8. RuMMS samples, hosting sites, C2 servers from Jan. 2016 to Mar. 2016 We do not know exactly how many people have been infected with RuMMS malware; however, our data suggests that there are at least 2,729 infections with RuMMS samples from January 2016 to early April 2016. Figure 9 shows the number of RuMMS infections recorded in the last four months. When we first observed the malware in January, we recorded 380 infections. In February, we recorded 767 infections. In March, it peaked at 1,169 infections. In April, at the time of writing this post, we recorded 413 RuMMS infections. Although the propagation trend seems to be slowing down a bit, the figure tells us that RuMMS malware is still alive in the wild. We continue to monitor its progress. Figure 9. RuMMS infections from Jan. 2016 to Apr. 15, 2016 Conclusion Smishing (SMS phishing) offers a unique vector to infect mobile users. The recent RuMMS campaign shows that Smishing is still a popular means for threat actors to distribute their malware. In addition, the use of shared-hosting providers adds flexibility to the threat actor’s campaign and makes it harder for defending parties to track these moving targets. Fortunately, FireEye Mobile Threat Prevention platform can recognize the malicious SMS and networking behaviors used by these RuMMS samples, and help us quickly identify the threat. To protect yourself from these threats, <e2>FireEye</e2> suggests that users: Take caution before clicking any links where you are not sure about the origin. [SEP]

[CLS] In total, 17,490 new samples of the malware have been found on two related servers by <e2>Trend Micro</e2>. Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. The majority of which appear to be Turkish, according to the language settings used by social media accounts sending commands. Once commands have been accepted, Anubis can hijack devices, steal data, and send information to command-and-control (C2) servers which have spread worldwide. The new variants are also able to detect if they are running on virtual machines (VMs), a common way for researchers to safely unpack and analyze malware. In Anubis' case, this also includes Android emulators such as Genymotion. Anubis is not the only Android malware variant which is being constantly improved and refined by its developers. Last week, <e1>Fortinet</e1> researchers said BianLian -- which began life as a dropper for Anubis and is now an established banking Trojan on its own accord -- is now bypassing Google Android protections to propagate its malicious code.

[CLS] 'Pegasus' iOS malware package also found to impact OS X, Apple issues patch Apple in a patch last week blocked a particularly nasty malware package called "<e1>Pegasus</e1>" from infiltrating iOS devices, and the company is now doing the same for its OS X desktop operating system. Apple on Thursday issued security updates for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Safari to address a vulnerability that potentially allows nefarious agents to take over a target device with a single click. Dubbed "Pegasus," the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more. Apple patched the vulnerability last week when it released iOS 9.3.5. It appears the same WebKit and kernel vulnerabilities that enable Pegasus to effectively infiltrate iOS devices also exist in OS X. To combat potential exposure, Apple issued a combined security update for OS X Yosemite and El Capitan, as well as a standalone fix for the Safari web browser. The combined OS X update includes the Safari patch. Pegasus was discovered by Citizen Lab and Lookout after a human rights activist was sent a link leading to a malicious webpage bearing the jailbreak and remote monitoring tools. An investigation into the malware revealed NSO, an Israeli-based organization owned by <e2>U.S.</e2> company Francisco Partners Management, likely crafted Pegasus to further its "cyber war" line of products.

[CLS] Lookout Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as Desert Scorpion in the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>. Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

[CLS] We found traces of the <e1>Gooligan</e1> malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, MonkeyTest, and Xinyinhe. By late <e2>2015</e2>, the malware’s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes. [SEP]
[CLS] This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available <e1>BankBot</e1> code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, <e2>North-America</e2> and Australia.

[CLS] Unique <e1>Monokle</e1> Android Spyware Self-Signs Certificates Researchers have linked the surveillance tool to a Russian tech firm that has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A never-before-publicized mobile spy tool, a mobile surveillanceware remote access trojan (RAT) for Android called Monokle, has been spotted using novel techniques to exfiltrate data. According to the Lookout researchers who discovered Monokle in the wild, the malware has the ability to self-sign trusted certificates to intercept encrypted SSL traffic. It can also record a phone’s lockscreen activity in order to obtain passcodes, and it can leverage accessibility services to gain access to <e2>third-party apps</e2>. “While most of its functionality is typical of a mobile surveillanceware, Monokle is unique in that it uses existing methods in novel ways in order to be extremely effective at data exfiltration, even without root access,” according to a report issued on Wednesday.

[CLS] Conclusion and security recommendations The continued monitoring of <e1>XLoader</e1> showed how its operators continuously changed its features, such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques. This newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won’t be stopping soon. Being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies, as well as prepare for upcoming attacks. In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we’ve also seen in a different malware family like FakeSpy also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

[CLS] Abusing Android's Accessibility Features to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the <e2>CERT-Bund</e2> last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices. CERT-Bund's advisory went on to state that the Windows computers infected by TrickBot employed man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to ask victims for their online banking mobile phone numbers and device types in order to prompt them to install a fake security app — now called TrickMo. But given the security threats posed by SMS-based authentication — the messages can be easily hijacked by rogue third-party apps and are also vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks — <e1>banks</e1> are beginning to increasingly rely on push notifications for users, which contain the transaction details and the TAN number. [SEP]
[CLS] Meanwhile, the <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's <e2>app store</e2>. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. [SEP]

[CLS] More on <e1>Anubis</e1> Malware Anubis is a mobile malware that affects Android smartphones and is spread using malicious apps listed on the legitimate Google Play store. The banking malware initially surfaced on Russian hacking forums in 2016, where it was distributed as an open-source banking trojan with guidance on how to set up the client and components. In 2019, the malware introduced what seemed to be a nearly working ransomware component and spread using fraudulent apps on Google’s Play Store. Anubis reappeared last year with large-scale phishing attacks that targeted 250 shopping and financial applications. Anubis M.O. When potential victims access apps for targeted platforms, Anubis malware will show bogus phishing login forms in order to steal their credentials. The overlay screen shown below will be displayed over the genuine app’s login screen to trick users into assuming it’s a valid login form when, in fact, the hackers are receiving their credentials. According to BleepingComputer, the latest version of Anubis targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a <e2>keylogger</e2> login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device.

[CLS] Most infections (40 per cent) are in Asia, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in <e2>North America</e2>, Shaulov said. Another 12 per cent are based in Europe. Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers.

The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same.

[CLS] Mobile <e1>Rotexy</e1> Malware Touts Ransomware, Banking Trojan Functions A mobile malware has accelerated its activity in 2018, launching more than 70k attacks in August through October. Mobile malware, dubbed Rotexy, has evolved from being spyware to now a dangerous banking trojan packing a host of new clever features. Researchers report 70,000 attacks between August and October with targets primarily based in Russia. In a technical brief released last week, researchers at Kaspersky Lab shed new light on the Rotexy malware, which was first spotted in October 2014 as an SMS spyware trojan. “The modern version of Rotexy combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware,” wrote Kaspersky Lab researchers Tatyana Shishkova and Lev Pikman. The latest version of the malware goes well beyond eavesdropping on SMS messages and has incorporated advanced device screen manipulation with the intent of stealing bank card numbers, as well carrying out ransomware attacks, they said. The Kaspersky analysis details four years of steady improvements to Rotexy. The trojan’s staple and unique feature has always been the use of a combination of three command-and-control sources which include conventional C&C servers, SMS messaging and utilizing the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform (where it sends small messages in JavaScript Object Notation format to a mobile device using Google servers). “This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of Rotexy and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives,” researchers said. Originally, the trojan was identified as Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but as it grew more sophisticated researchers assigned it to another family – Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy. Rotexy’s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of <e2>antivirus</e2> or banking applications).

Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, <e1>Check Point</e1> warned. [SEP]

The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer.

[CLS] Cerberus and <e1>Alien</e1>: the malware that has put Android in a tight spot The most complex Android malware in recent years has released its source code and malicious actors have their own forks, strongly motivated by financial gain. Is 2020 the year of smartphone malware? 2020 is the year of the rat, and we actually aren’t talking about the Chinese horoscope. According to several cybersecurity researchers, 2020 has seen an explosive increase in Remote access Trojans, or “RATs”. This threat is not minor: a RAT can take control of your computer in the same way that a remote administrator would normally do, using tools such as TeamViewer or VNC. In this case, it’s a malicious control: a RAT steals your personal information trying to carry out bank or identity fraud. However, and with the migration of PC users to the mobile world, hackers changed their strategy. Now there is a whole series of malware focused on bank credentials and identity theft, especially designed for Android mobile devices. These RATs have reached a high level of sophistication, and most are offered in the form of “malware as a service”, or MaaS. Between 2019 and 2020 these attacks have become increasingly common. Names like Anubis, Hydra, Ginp, or Gustuff appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. However, the one that has dominated the arena this year –for several reasons– is Cerberus: a nightmare-inducing rodent. Cerberus, the king of all RATs Cerberus is a highly sophisticated Android malware, in circulation since 2019. It has been actively distributed on dark web forums, in a “malware-as-a-service” (MaaS) format. For a sum between $4,000 and $12,000, cybercriminal groups capable of paying it have had all the malware tools at their disposal. And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. Cerberus was conceived as a run-of-the-mill <e2>banking and phishing malware</e2>, and seeing Anubis’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset.

[CLS] Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by <e1>German banks</e1>. In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a “kill switch” that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device. Why Do Desktop Trojans Use a Mobile Component? About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim’s online banking account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client’s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous Zeus Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ZitMo” (Zeus in the Mobile). This was used to bypass 2FA methods by intercepting the SMS messages coming from the bank and stealing the mTANs without the victim’s knowledge. Many other banking malware families followed suit and released their own Android malware components designed to steal those OTPs and TANs. From mTAN to pushTAN In the past few years, some banks in <e2>Europe</e2>, especially in Germany, stopped using SMS-based authentication and switched to dedicated pushTAN applications for 2FA schemes.

[CLS] ” The malicious version of the Orange Telecom account management app was submitted to the Google Play store in July 2021 and later removed, but the researchers warned that they believe this campaign was just a test of <e1>Google</e1>’s antivirus protections and will likely resurface soon. “We found that obfuscation efforts were only partially implemented within the app and that there were additional developments still occurring with its command-and-control (C2) server,” the report added. “We expect more heavily obfuscated distributions will be submitted in the future.” New Anubis Tricks Once downloaded on the device, the banking trojan makes a connection with the command-and-control (C2) server and downloads another application to initiate the SOCKS5 proxy. “This proxy allows the attacker to enforce authentication for clients communicating with their server and mask communications between the client and C2. Once retrieved and decrypted, the APK is saved as ‘FR.apk’ in ‘/data/data/fr.orange.serviceapp/app_apk,'” the researchers wrote. A scam message then pops up asking the user to disable Google Play Protect, giving the attacker full control, the report said. The analysts found more than 394 unique apps targeted by fr.orange.serviceapp, including banks, reloadable card companies and cryptocurrency wallets. The Lookout team traced the Anubis client to a half-built crypto trading platform. First identified in 2016, Anubis is widely available on underground forums as open-source code along with instructions for aspiring banking trojan cybercriminals, the report explained. In this latest iteration of Anubis code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including Bank of America, <e2>U.S. Bank</e2>, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust and Wells Fargo,” Balaam said.

The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload.

[CLS] SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as <e1>OmniRat</e1> and DroidJack. Droidjack made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. OmniRat is similar in function and was first spotted in Germany in November by researchers who said targeted victims received a text message asking them to download an app to view an image. Once installed, SpyNote is hard to get rid of; it removes the SpyNote application icon from the victim’s phone and install new APKs and update the malware. “The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card,” according to a technical description of malware. Palo Alto has gleaned important details of SpyNote from what it identifies as a video demonstrating the capabilities of the malware. In the video hacking tutorial a user appears to be running SpyNote through its paces showing a remote takeover of an Android device. “The uploader might be following the instructions described in <e2>YouTube</e2> videos on using SpyNote, considering the port number used is exactly the same as in the videos and the uploader only changes the icon of the APK file,” wrote Jacob Soo.

[CLS] According to <e2>ThreatFabric</e2>, the operators of Cerberus released a new variant of their creation in mid-January 2020. This version came with a new remote-access Trojan (RAT) capability that allowed Cerberus to traverse the file system and download its contents. It also enabled the malware to launch TeamViewer and establish connections to it. Such functionality granted full access over an infected device to Cerberus’ handlers. As such, they could leverage that functionality to change the device’s settings, install or remove any app, use an app, and conduct espionage on the device’s activity. Not only that, but the threat actors could use a simple overlay in Cerberus requiring its victims to unlock their device. The overlay analyzed by researchers stole victims’ screen lock codes/credentials, allowing the threat actors to remotely unlock a device for the purpose of performing fraud. Attackers could also abuse the Accessibility features to steal 2FA codes from the Google Authentication app for the purpose of bypassing authentication services. A Look Back at Cerberus ThreatFabric first came across Cerberus in June 2019. What stuck out for researchers at that time was the fact that Cerberus lacked features that could have helped the malware to avoid detection in the process of abusing stolen information and perpetuating fraud. Not only that, but the malware operators also used a Twitter account at the time to both publish promotional materials for their creation and make fun of the antivirus community. A few months later in September 2019, security firm <e1>Buguroo</e1> revealed that it had detected a new version of Cerberus targeting Spanish and Latin American entities. [SEP]
[CLS] 0 (Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in <e2>third-party app stores</e2> as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both Android and Flash Player. Once a user downloads one of these malicious apps into their devices and opens it, a popup overlay will appear prompting the user to enter their login credentials. The credentials are then sent to a Command and Control (C&C server) that the attackers control. Red Alert 2.0 will block incoming calls from banks, presumably to block verification attempts. The malware also intercepts SMS text messages, sending messages to the attackers for future use. By disrupting the device’s actual communication capabilities, the attackers can maximize the time spent doing malicious activities. According to its researchers, Red Alert 2.0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500—a low price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers. Red Alert 2.0 can target mobile devices that are running Android versions of up to 6.0, which was released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores. No versions of the malicious apps carrying the malware have been detected on the official Google Play Store as of the time of publication. This is not the first time that malware is being spread via third party app stores, as seen in last year’s <e1>Fobus</e1> attack involving Super Mario Run. [SEP]

Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers.

[CLS] Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, <e2>Check Point</e2> warned.

Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The <e1>Chinese cybercriminals</e1> behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. [SEP]
[CLS] The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware <e1>Triout</e1>. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults.” Attackers aim to backdoor legitimate applications with an unusual injection technique dubbed Smali. The mobile malware also aims to inject legitimate mobile applications with a backdoor for persistent access once it has compromised an Android device. “To backdoor legitimate applications, attackers used a Smali injection technique – a type of injection that allows attackers to disassemble the code of original app with the Baksmali tool, add their malicious code, and assemble it with Smali.” reads the analysis published by Kaspersky. “As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files.” The ViceLeaker APK implements very common spyware features (exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs, and device information) along with backdoor capabilities (upload, download, delete files, camera takeover, and record surrounding audio). ViceLeaker leverages HTTP for C&C communications and to transfer exfiltrated data. During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “<e2>Conversations</e2>.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app. [SEP]

[CLS] Ongoing activity While monitoring this particular threat, we found another XLoader variant posing as a <e2>pornography app</e2> aimed at South Korean users. The "porn kr sex" APK connects to a malicious website that runs XLoader in the background. The website uses a different fixed twitter account (https://twitter.com/fdgoer343).

[CLS] In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known Android banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed <e1>Alien</e1>, and explain how it relates to infamous Cerberus malware, who’s service has recently been discontinued. The preface, Cerberus August 2020 marked the demise of Cerberus, the most successful Android banking Trojan service, or MaaS (Malware as a Service), of the last 12 months. Details about the Trojan can be found in our blog about from August last year. Apparently due to issues related to shortcomings of the staff within the threat actor’s technical team, architectural and technical issues with the Trojan remained unsolved long enough for Google Play Protect to detect all related samples on the spot on all infected devices, of course resulting in unhappy customers. At the end of July, because of these issues, the actor behind Cerberus tried to sell the service, including the customer portfolio, in the hopes another actor would continue his work. Our telemetry, as seen in the graph below, shows a steady decrease of new Cerberus samples starting from this moment. After a series of customer complaints and due to his fruitless attempts to sell the source code of the Trojan as a whole, the owner of the malware finally decided to end the rental service and refund active license holders. On August 10th 2020 he shared the source code of Cerberus with the administrator of the underground forum in which he was renting it out. As we forecasted, shortly after, the source code of the Trojan became available to the general public. You might wonder why the number of samples drops and barely increases again despite the source code being publicly available. There are two reasons: firstly, actors who got their hands on the code need to understand how to setup the backend (C2) and builder, secondly the actors which successfully built samples noticed that their payload is immediately detected by <e2>Play Protect</e2> when installed on an Android device and therefore are now probably working on rearranging the code (resulting in their own code fork).

When potential victims access apps for targeted platforms, Anubis malware will show bogus phishing login forms in order to steal their credentials. The overlay screen shown below will be displayed over the genuine app’s login screen to trick users into assuming it’s a valid login form when, in fact, the hackers are receiving their credentials. According to BleepingComputer, the latest version of Anubis targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a keylogger login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device. The newest Anubis acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the fake Orange app is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts.

Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as <e2>Telegram</e2>. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. [SEP]

[CLS] A new Android malware has appeared in the threat landscape, tracked as <e1>MobiHok</e1> RAT, it borrows the code from the old SpyNote RAT. Experts from threat intelligence firm SenseCy spotted a new piece of Android RAT, dubbed MobiHok RAT, that used code from the old SpyNote RAT. At the beginning of July 2019, the experts spotted a threat actor dubbed mobeebom that was offering for sale an Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT) dubbed MobiHok v4 on a prominent English hacking forum. The experts discovered that mobeebom is active on multiple Arab-speaking hacking forums under different pseudonyms, a circumstance that suggests that he is an Arab-speaker. Researchers also noticed that the posts published by the hacker were using poor English. mobeebom has been promoting the MobiHok RAT through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since January 2019. MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In July 2016, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like <e2>OmniRat</e2> and DroidJack, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum.

[CLS] maza-in names the malware Anubis and used the following logo in his advertisement of the malware: The list of bot features below shows how much maza-in improved upon the original shared BankBot code to create (the latest version of) Anubis: Overlaying: Static (hardcoded in bot) Overlaying: Dynamic (C2 based) Keylogging Contact list collection Screen streaming Sound recording SMS harvesting: SMS forwarding SMS blocking SMS sending Files/pictures collection Calls: USSD request making Ransomware: Cryptolocker Remote actions: Data-wiping Remote actions: Back-connect proxy Notifications: Push notifications C2 Resilience: Twitter/Telegram/Pastebin C2 update channels In addition to the new features and improvements made, <e1>Anubis</e1> also has a larger (default) target list. In the Appendix you can find a full list of apps targeted by Anubis (437 applications in total). Distribution As a rented Trojan, Anubis was distributed using a wide range of delivery techniques: Google Play campaigns: using self-made or rented droppers actors were able to bypass Google Play security mechanisms and spread the Trojan using the official app store, potentially infecting thousands of victims at a time. Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of Anubis 2 was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. During Q1 2019, actor maza-in vanished from the threat landscape, leaving existing customers without support and updates. Although exact details about the vanishing of the actor remain unclear at the time of writing, a chain of events confirms that some abnormal activity took place around Anubis and its author. On December 13 2018 maza-in announces the release of <e2>Anubis 2.5</e2>; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code. [SEP]

[CLS] Pegasus For Android: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, <e1>Lookout</e1> and Google are releasing research into the Android version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: Pegasus. A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets. Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to <e2>The New York Times</e2>. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. [SEP]
[CLS] One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, <e1>Q-Cyber</e1>, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program.

[CLS] Previously in 2015, we saw the <e2>Rootnik</e2> Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. SpyDealer 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file /data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip which contains all the rooting exploits. If there is no such file, the malware will download it from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip. The file integrity is then inspected by comparing the MD5 value of the downloaded file and the pre-calculated one from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/md5.txt. Unzips the downloaded file to the app’s data directory and attempt to gain root privilege by systematically executing the exploits one by one. Installs busybox and remounts system partition as read-write by running a sequence of shell commands with superuser permission. The downloaded file “raw.zip” contains the exploits from “Baidu Easy Root” version 2.8.3, which is depicted in Figure 4. Table 2 gives a full list of the exploits stolen by SpyDealer. For example, 022d251cf509c2f0 is an executable binary file observed in the “raw.zip”, and the original file in “Baidu Easy Root” is actually in gzip format. It’s interesting that we can recover its original file name which is fb_mem_root. SpyDealer 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 also gain root privilege thought another method that doesn’t use “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drop files including sux, getroot, logo.png and busybox_g1 from assets to the app’s own data directory. Copy files sux, logo.png and busybox_g1 that are dropped in the above step to <e1>/data/data/ <package_name>/app_bin</e1> Generate shell script /data/data/<package_name>/app_bin/toor. [SEP]
[CLS] "In similar attacks, such as <e1>Dark Caracal</e1>, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to <e2>Special Technology Centre</e2> (STC), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. [SEP]
[CLS] Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan Anubis – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at <e1>Lookout</e1> warned in a new report. And it’s not just customers of big <e2>banks</e2> at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted. [SEP]
[CLS] Through this blog post <e2>ThreatFabric</e2> experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities <e1>Razdel</e1> (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] Royal Mail, DHL Group, France's Las Poste, Taiwan's Chunghwa Post, several private delivery companies in Japan as well as others in <e2>Switzerland</e2> and Germany, Cybereason researchers say. If the recipient clicks on the links in these messages, malicious code is downloaded onto the Android device that installs the FakeSpy malware. The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday. FakeSpy has been active in the wild since at least 2017. Its operators have been refining the information stealer’s code over the last three years and adding capabilities, according to Cybereason. The latest version has a larger target list that includes the U.S. and Europe. "The threat actors are preying on unsuspecting victims because people tend to open emails and messages when it comes to their deliveries," Assaf Dahan, senior director and head of threat research at Cybereason, tells Information Security Media Group. "And one of the main communication methods of these companies - <e1>postal services</e1> and transportation services - is by SMS. [SEP]
[CLS] During the past three years, security researchers from Citizen Lab, a laboratory at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, <e2>Canada</e2>, have been tracking cases where Pegasus has been deployed in the wild. In many instances, the spyware was used by oppressive government regimes to spy on journalists, human rights defenders, opposition politicians, lawyers, and anti-corruption advocates. But new data published today by <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the Pegasus spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place.

[CLS] Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. <e2>Targeting Postal</e2> and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - <e1>Deutsche Post DHL Group</e1>, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. [SEP]

[CLS] Patent and Trademark Office via <e2>AP</e2> Governments and phone companies can track a phone’s location by tracking cell signals from cell tower transceivers and cell transceiver simulators like the StingRay device. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals can also be used to track phones. In some cases, apps and web browsers can determine a phone’s location. Eavesdropping on communications is harder to accomplish than tracking, but it is possible in situations in which encryption is weak or lacking. Some types of malware can compromise privacy by accessing data.

[CLS] INTRODUCTION For the past several weeks, <e1>Cybereason</e1> has been investigating a new version of Android malware dubbed FakeSpy, which was first identified in October 2017 and reported again in October 2018. A new campaign is up and running using newly improved, significantly more powerful malware as compared to previous versions. FakeSpy is under active development and is evolving rapidly; new versions are released every week with additional evasion techniques and capabilities. Our analysis shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy malware is a Chinese-speaking group, commonly referred to as "Roaming Mantis", a group that is known to have launched similar campaigns in the past. FakeSpy is an information stealer that exfiltrates and sends SMS messages, steals financial and application data, reads account information and contact lists, and more. The malware uses smishing, or SMS phishing, to infiltrate target devices, which is a technique that relies on social engineering. The attackers send fake text messages to lure the victims to click on a malicious link. The link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK). This most recent FakeSpy campaign appears to target users of postal services around the world. New versions of FakeSpy masquerade as government post office apps and transportation services apps. Our analysis indicates that the threat actors are no longer limiting their campaigns to East Asian countries, but are targeting additional countries around the world. THREAT ANALYSIS Infection Vector: Smishing Your Device Thus far, FakeSpy campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a. smishing). These SMS messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the FakeSpy download. In a previous campaign reported by <e2>JPCERT</e2>, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>HACKING TEAM</e1> BREACH HANGOVER: ANDROID SPYWARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE When your business is making software, you want to keep the software code safe because it is the intellectual property that your profits hang on. When your business is writing exploits and malicious code, you want to keep it safe because your profits and the safety of others depend on it. The Hacking Team breach that occur a few weeks ago has released into the wild the tools necessary to infect Android with spyware. Called RCSAndroid it has been termed “one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed” by Trend Micro. <e2>RCSANDROID</e2> has the ability to: Collect Passwords for both networks (your WiFi) and accounts (your bank) Collect your location Record you calls or what is being said around your device Collect you contact information Collect you email and texts And a lot more.

[CLS] We named this specific Android Trojan “<e2>RootAngel</e2>”. After the service is started by guardmb, and install the SU daemon. It will also connect with its C2 server, download more Android apps and install them in background through “pm install” command. Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example, for a 64-bit Windows PC, “AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi” and <e1>“AppleApplicationSupport64.msi”</e1> will be downloaded. [SEP]
[CLS] In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known Android banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed Alien, and explain how it relates to infamous <e1>Cerberus</e1> malware, who’s service has recently been discontinued. The preface, Cerberus August 2020 marked the demise of Cerberus, the most successful Android banking Trojan service, or MaaS (Malware as a Service), of the last 12 months. Details about the Trojan can be found in our blog about from August last year. Apparently due to issues related to shortcomings of the staff within the threat actor’s technical team, architectural and technical issues with the Trojan remained unsolved long enough for <e2>Google Play Protect</e2> to detect all related samples on the spot on all infected devices, of course resulting in unhappy customers. [SEP]
[CLS] The group has been linked to Hamas’s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students. <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the <e2>chat app</e2>, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. [SEP]
[CLS] One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. [SEP]
[CLS] Once an application has been identified, <e1>Anubis</e1> overlays the original application with a fake login page to capture the user’s credentials. Based on a thorough analysis of the code, the most interesting technical capabilities include: Capturing screenshots Enabling or changing administration settings Opening and visiting any URL Disabling Play Protect Recording audio Making phone calls Stealing the contact list Controlling the device via VNC Sending, receiving and deleting SMS Locking the device Encrypting files on the device and external drives Searching for files Retrieving the GPS location Capturing remote control commands from Twitter and Telegram Pushing overlays Reading the device ID The malware includes a keylogger that works in every app installed on the Android device. However, the keylogger needs to be specifically enabled by a command sent from the C2 server. The keylogger can track three different events (Figure 5): TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED Represents the event of clicking on a View-like Button, CompoundButton, etc. TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED Represents the event of setting input focus of a View. TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED Represents the event of changing the text of an EditText. Figure 6 shows one of the most noteworthy functions of Anubis: its ransomware module. The malware searches both internal and external storage and encrypts them using RC4. It adds the file extension .AnubisCrypt to each encrypted file and sends it to the C2. Anubis has been known to utilize Twitter or Telegram to retrieve the C2 address and this sample is no exception (Figure 7). As seen in Figure 8, this version of Anubis is built to run on several iterations of the Android operating system, dating back to version 4.0.3, which was released in <e2>2012</e2>. Android malware has been around for many years and will be with us for the foreseeable future. [SEP]
[CLS] luo vs the decrypted JAR file <e1>mycode.jar,</e1> it is interesting to note that it is the same file (almost the same size). After libmsy.so decrypts the asset file tong.luo, it loads mycode.jar dynamically into FakeSpy’s process, as is shown from the output of the “adb logcat” command. By analyzing running processes on the infected device, it shows that the malware creates a child process of itself to perform the multi-process ptrace anti-debugging technique. By performing a deep analysis of the malware, we were able to extract the unpacked JAR file mycode.jar and reveal some very interesting code. STEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION <e2>FakeSpy</e2> has multiple built in information stealing capabilities. [SEP]

Curiously, several of these have included the world "Fateh" in their package name, which may be referring to the Fatah political party. Such references would be in line with FrozenCell's phishing tactics in which they used file names to lure people associated with the political party to open malicious documents. Desert Scorpion's second stage is capable of installing another non-malicious application (included in the second stage) which is highly specific to the Fatah political party and supports the targeting theory. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team is increasingly seeing the same tradecraft, tactics, and procedures that APT-C-23 favors being used by other actors. The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the Google Play Store, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like <e1>Pegasus</e1> or FinFisher. [SEP]
[CLS] On February 14 2019 for the first time an Anubis sample seen targeting Russian banks only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator). On <e2>February 25 2019</e2> some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. <e1>Marcher</e1> In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis.

[CLS] The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its <e2>spyware</e2> from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like ZergHelper. It also has exactly the same behavior as <e1>AceDeceiver</e1>.

The <e1>Chinese cybercriminals</e1> behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year. The initial warnings about Ghost Push landed in September last year, and Google said in April it was the most successful Android malware of 2015, infecting around 4 million phones in its various forms. It also rooted devices and displayed malicious ads. In October, security firm Cheetah Mobile Security said thredifferent versions of Ghost Push were propagating at a rate of 10,000 installs a day. The Gooligan hackers' escapades date back to at least June 2015, however, when the first evidence of the malware code was found. Check Point saw Android phones infected with malicious software containing early Gooligan code when physically connected to PCs running a <e2>Windows</e2> back-up tool, SnapPea. [SEP]

[CLS] Expect a visit from the police Law enforcement agencies across Europe have searched homes this week, as part of an international crackdown against users of a notorious piece of Android malware known as DroidJack. <e1>Droidjack</e1> is a remote access trojan (RAT). If you’re a jealous partner, or thinking of stalking someone’s activity and movements, then DroidJack could be just the ticket – as it allows you to take remote control of someone else’s Android device without them noticing, recording private conversations, reading emails, browser history and text messages, as well as tracking their physical location. Maybe the news that police have raided and searched at least thirteen homes in a pan-European investigation will make some potential DroidJack purchasers think twice. According to reports, action was taken in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, targeting people who had bought DroidJack and used it since <e2>2014.</e2> According to a BBC News report, searches were also conducted in the United States.

[CLS] Researchers analyzed code from a campaign in April 2020 that downloaded the Fakespy version impersonating Taiwan’s <e2>Chungwha Post</e2> app. Once the user clicked on the malicious link, the app asked them to approve installation. The app’s PackageInstaller showed its permission access and asks for the user’s approval, which then installed the application. During installation, researchers observed FakeSpy gaining access to numerous permissions, including the ability to: read, write, send and receive SMS messages; open network sockets and access the internet; write to external storage; read from internal storage; and access information about networks to which the device is connected, among others. After installation, the app begins its “real malicious activity” by downloading a set of dynamic libraries from the libmsy.so file, which executes the packed mycode.jar file to load various insidious information-stealing capabilities into FakeSpy’s process onto the device, Almkias said. Once FakeSpy is on the device, it steals all contacts in the device’s contact list and their information, as well as the infected device’s data. That includes the mobile number, the device model, the OS version, and banking and cryptocurrency app information. It also asks to be the device’s default SMS app so the malware can spread to other devices. Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise FakeSpy are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and Swiss Post. <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> used the Android developer tool WebView to build the fake applications, which is what gives them their authenticity, Almkias said. [SEP]
[CLS] We found that among the leaked files is the code for Hacking Team’s open-source malware suite <e2>RCSAndroid</e2> (Remote Control System Android), which was sold by the company as a tool for monitoring targets. (Researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014.) The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations. Based on the leaked code, the RCSAndroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger. Capture real-time voice calls in any network or app by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service RCSAndroid in the Wild Our analysis reveals that this RCSAndroid (AndroidOS_RCSAgent.HRX) has been in the wild since 2012. Traces of its previous uses in the wild were found inside the configuration file: It was configured to use a Command-and-control (C&C) server in the United States; however, the server was bought from a host service provider and is now unavailable. It was configured to activate via SMS sent from a Czech Republic number. Attackers can send SMS with certain messages to activate the agent and trigger corresponding action. This can also define what kind of evidences to collect. Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of <e1>Czech firms</e1> appear to be in business with the Hacking team, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. [SEP]

Rotexy Trojan Blocking the Display: User’s phone display has been blocked for a long duration by showing the fake updating page by Rotexy Trojan Malware. Rotexy Trojan Malware blocks the user’s phone display and shows a Ransome page with some sexually explicit image (that has been covered within a black box). Similarly, Rotexy Trojan Malware blocks the user phone screens and display banking page to enter the bank details. Once the user enters the bank detail it sends all information to the C&C server. As Rotexy Trojan already has control on your incoming messages and also received bank details then the attacker can perform any transaction or even can change password, ATM card Debit card PIN. How to unblock a Phone: Now, with this serious problem, the good news is Rotexy Trojan Malware processing module is not well designed. So, once a phone gets blocked then it can be unlocked by sending “3458” in an SMS to the number which is in the blocked phone. This SMS will revoke the admin access of this Trojan over the device then send another message “stop_blocker”. The second message will stop the screen <e2>blocker</e2> and leads to unlocking the user’s phone. [SEP]
[CLS] It was removed after Lookout notified <e2>Google</e2> on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the <e1>Fatah</e1> political party.

[CLS] An investigation of <e1>Chrysaor</e1> Malware on Android Google is constantly working to improve our systems that protect users from Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs). Usually, PHA authors attempt to install their harmful apps on as many devices as possible. However, a few PHA authors spend substantial effort, time, and money to create and install their harmful app on one or a very small number of devices. This is known as a targeted attack. In this blog post, we describe Chrysaor, a newly discovered family of spyware that was used in a targeted attack on a small number of Android devices, and how investigations like this help Google protect Android users from a variety of threats. What is Chrysaor? Chrysaor is spyware believed to be created by NSO Group Technologies, specializing in the creation and sale of software and infrastructure for targeted attacks. Chrysaor is believed to be related to the Pegasus spyware that was first identified on iOS and analyzed by Citizen Lab and Lookout. Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to Pegasus, which we named Chrysaor. Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps. We gathered information from affected devices, and concurrently, attempted to acquire Chrysaor apps to better understand its impact on users. We've contacted the potentially affected users, disabled the applications on affected devices, and implemented changes in <e2>Verify Apps</e2> to protect all users. [SEP]

Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique <e1>CometBot</e1> (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and <e1>FakeSpy</e1> have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices. This variant is distributed via smishing. XLoader version 6.0 abuses Twitter profiles to hide its C&C server. The malware author has made some changes to this XLoader version in line with its new deployment method. XLoader version 7.0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘XLoader version 7.0’ that poses as a <e2>pornography app</e2> for Android devices. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode. "<e1>Monokle</e1> is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software," Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told ZDNet. "It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device." While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (STC), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being "complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities" against the <e2>US</e2>.

[CLS] Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to <e1>Exodux</e1>, hosted an iOS version of the malware. The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers. Researchers said that a company called eSurv S.R.L. was also involved. eSurv was once a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L. in 2014. In <e2>2016</e2>, the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa to eSurv S. [SEP]

[CLS] <e1>Skygofree</e1>: Following in the footsteps of HackingTeam At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. We observed many web landing pages that mimic the sites of mobile operators and which are used to spread the Android implants. These domains have been registered by the attackers since <e2>2015</e2>. According to our telemetry, that was the year the distribution campaign was at its most active. [SEP]
[CLS] Logs collected by Check Point researchers show that every day <e1>Gooligan</e1> installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages. After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign’s Command and Control (C&C) server. Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware HummingBad. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user’s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install <e2>adware</e2> to generate revenue Ad servers, which don’t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play. [SEP]
[CLS] The <e2>Dardesh</e2> app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family Desert Scorpion. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. “The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,” the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed <e1>APT-C-23</e1> to be behind this scheme. [SEP]

[CLS] Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did <e2>Google</e2>, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes.

A new version of the SpyNote Trojan is designed to trick Android users into thinking it’s a legitimate Netflix application. Once installed, the remote access Trojan (RAT) essentially hands control of the device over to the hacker, enabling them to copy files, view contacts, and eavesdrop on the victim, among other capabilities. The malware is a new twist on the SpyNote RAT, a Trojan first uncovered on the dark web last summer by Palo Alto Networks. The most recent iteration, a product of the SpyNote Trojan builder, mimics a Netflix app and was discovered recently by researchers with Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ. <e2>Deepen Desai</e2>, Zscaler’s senior director of security research and operations, told Threatpost Tuesday that while researchers haven’t seen this particular RAT variant being spammed in the wild yet, they did see it on one of their threat feeds.

[CLS] One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of <e2>Uganda</e2> earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and <e1>Apple</e1> noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.

[CLS] The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses <e2>Armenia</e2>, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (STC), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being "complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities" against the US. The defense contractor is one of three companies sanctioned for providing material support to the <e1>Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)</e1> in election interference campaigns. [SEP]

[CLS] Citizen Lab didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in <e1>Apple</e1> app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of Pegasus’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime messages or notifications. Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV. “Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,” according to Citizen Lab. KISMET likely doesn’t work against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections, Citizen Labs noted. Apple meanwhile is looking into the issue. Inside One Victim’s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in <e2>Germany</e2>, France, U. [SEP]
[CLS] <e2>Lookout</e2> Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as Desert Scorpion in the Google Play Store. Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The <e1>Lookout Threat Intelligence</e1> team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27.

The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the <e2>Apple</e2>-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers.

[CLS] Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known <e2>VROOT (CVE-2013-6282)</e2> and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware HummingBad. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user’s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install adware to generate revenue Ad servers, which don’t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from <e1>Google Play</e1>. After an app is installed, the ad service pays the attacker. [SEP]
[CLS] XLoader linked to <e1>Yanbian</e1> hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices. This variant is distributed via smishing. XLoader version 6.0 abuses Twitter profiles to hide its C&C server. The malware author has made some changes to this XLoader version in line with its new deployment method. XLoader version 7.0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘XLoader version 7.0’ that poses as a pornography app for Android devices. This variant abuses Instagram and <e2>Tumblr</e2> profiles to hide its C&C server. [SEP]

[CLS] One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a <e2>memory corruption flaw</e2> in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more. Apple patched the vulnerability last week when it released iOS 9.3.5. It appears the same WebKit and kernel vulnerabilities that enable Pegasus to effectively infiltrate iOS devices also exist in OS X. To combat potential exposure, Apple issued a combined security update for <e1>OS X Yosemite</e1> and El Capitan, as well as a standalone fix for the Safari web browser. [SEP]
[CLS] The Rotexy mobile Trojan – banker and ransomware On the back of a surge in Trojan activity, we decided to carry out an in-depth analysis and track the evolution of some other popular malware families besides <e1>Asacub</e1>. One of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile Trojan from the Rotexy family. In a three-month period from August to October 2018, it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in Russia. An interesting feature of this family of banking Trojans is the simultaneous use of three command sources: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service – used to send small messages in JSON format to a mobile device via Google servers; malicious C&C server; incoming SMS messages. This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of Rotexy and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives. During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Trojan evolved from an SMS spyware Trojan that was first spotted in <e2>October 2014.</e2> Back then it was detected as Trojan-Spy.

[CLS] First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. <e1>Security Without Borders</e1> has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features. Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named Connexxa S.R.L. and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated <e2>Italian</e2> and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware, dubbed “Judy”, is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a <e2>Korean company</e2>. The malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements, generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it. The malicious apps reached an astonishing spread between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads. Some of the apps we discovered resided on Google Play for several years, but all were recently updated. It is unclear how long the malicious code existed inside the apps, hence the actual spread of the malware remains unknown. We also found several apps containing the malware, which were developed by other developers on Google Play. The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, and it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly. The oldest app of the second campaign was last updated in April 2016, meaning that the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play store undetected. These apps also had a large amount of downloads between 4 and 18 million, meaning the total spread of the malware may have reached between 8.5 and 36.5 million users. Similar to previous malware which infiltrated Google Play, such as FalseGuide and <e1>Skinner</e1>, Judy relies on the communication with its Command and Control server (C&C) for its operation. [SEP]
[CLS] Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of <e1>Czech firms</e1> appear to be in business with the Hacking team, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email.

[CLS] ” The malicious version of the Orange Telecom account management app was submitted to the Google Play store in July 2021 and later removed, but the researchers warned that they believe this campaign was just a test of <e1>Google</e1>’s antivirus protections and will likely resurface soon. “We found that obfuscation efforts were only partially implemented within the app and that there were additional developments still occurring with its command-and-control (C2) server,” the report added. “We expect more heavily obfuscated distributions will be submitted in the future.” New Anubis Tricks Once downloaded on the device, the banking trojan makes a connection with the command-and-control (C2) server and downloads another application to initiate the SOCKS5 proxy. “This proxy allows the attacker to enforce authentication for clients communicating with their server and mask communications between the client and C2. Once retrieved and decrypted, the APK is saved as ‘FR.apk’ in ‘/data/data/fr.orange.serviceapp/app_apk,'” the researchers wrote. A scam message then pops up asking the user to disable Google Play Protect, giving the attacker full control, the report said. The analysts found more than 394 unique apps targeted by fr.orange.serviceapp, including banks, reloadable card companies and cryptocurrency wallets. The Lookout team traced the Anubis client to a half-built crypto trading platform. First identified in 2016, Anubis is widely available on underground forums as open-source code along with instructions for aspiring banking trojan cybercriminals, the report explained. In this latest iteration of Anubis code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise. The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told <e2>Threatpost</e2>. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.

[CLS] Fortunately for us, after a while topics showing interest in a certain “Alien” malware started to appear in the underground forum and the author himself confirmed his affiliation to, and the name of, the Trojan: Based on our in-depth knowledge of the Trojan (available in our Mobile Threat Intelligence portal), we can prove that the Alien malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early January 2020 and rented out at the same time as Cerberus. <e1>Cerberus</e1> being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters. Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app. The code of that feature code is almost identical to that introduced with the Alien Trojan in February 2020. This indicates that at that time, the developer behind the Cerberus Trojan had access to, and might have been responsible for development of the Alien code. The code of the <e2>Google Authenticator</e2> 2FA stealer of the Alien Trojan is visible in following snippet: The Alien malware As described in previous sections, the Alien malware is a rented banking Trojan which offers more than the average capabilities of Android banking Trojans.

More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that <e1>Monarchy</e1> spied on,” Citizen Lab noted.

NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year.

Researchers said that a company called eSurv S.R.L. was also involved. eSurv was once a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L. in 2014. In 2016, the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa to eSurv S.R.L. It’s not clear how many iPhones were infected by the iOS apps. The iOS variant isn’t as sophisticated as Exodus was. Unlike Exodus, the iOS version wasn’t observed to use exploits. Instead, it relied on documented programming interfaces. It was nonetheless able to exfiltrate a variety of sensitive data including: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information Tell-tale signs Because the iOS variant relied on Apple-provided APIs, the malware provided alert users with some tell-tale signs that would have alerted vigilant users that their sensitive data was being tracked. For instance, the first time the malware attempted to access location data, an infected phone would have displayed the following dialogue, asking for permission: Lookout researchers reported their findings to <e1>Apple</e1>, and the company revoked the enterprise certificate.

[CLS] Unique <e1>Monokle</e1> Android Spyware Self-Signs Certificates Researchers have linked the surveillance tool to a Russian tech firm that has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A never-before-publicized mobile spy tool, a mobile surveillanceware remote access trojan (RAT) for Android called Monokle, has been spotted using novel techniques to exfiltrate data. According to the <e2>Lookout</e2> researchers who discovered Monokle in the wild, the malware has the ability to self-sign trusted certificates to intercept encrypted SSL traffic. [SEP]
[CLS] According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. <e1>Anubis</e1> Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches BankBot Anubis from one of its C&C servers. The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called “Google Protect” and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android’s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user’s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user’s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user’s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible. These features are staples of PC banking malware and are evolving in Android malware as well. The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address Turkish users. With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan <e2>Luxembourg</e2> Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U. [SEP]
[CLS] Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks <e2>MysteryBot</e2> (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code. The list of these original features is very limited compared to recent banking Trojans but enough to steal personal information from the victims: Overlaying: Dynamic - C2 based (possibility to remotely modify the list of targeted application) SMS blocking (hiding messages from the victim) SMS sending (capability to send messages from the infected device) SMS harvesting (possibility to send a copy of all message to the C2 server) About Anubis Rise of <e1>maza-in</e1> By publishing the aforementioned article, maza-in earned himself a reputation of Android expert on underground forums.

[CLS] Distribution As a rented Trojan, Anubis was distributed using a wide range of delivery techniques: Google Play campaigns: using self-made or rented droppers actors were able to bypass Google Play security mechanisms and spread the <e2>Trojan</e2> using the official app store, potentially infecting thousands of victims at a time. Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of <e1>Anubis 2</e1> was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. [SEP]
[CLS] That APK downloads an app that appears to be from the local region’s legitimate postal service—such as the <e2>United States Postal Service (USPS)</e2>–but actually executes FakeSpy, an infostealer that requests permissions to take over SMS messages and steal sensitive data on devices. The malware, which has been a threat since 2017, also can access and use a target device’s contact list to infect other devices. Researchers believe that Chinese-speaking group known as “Roaming Mantis” is behind the campaign. Disguising malware as a legitimate mobile app is a hallmark of Roaming Mantis. The last major campaign from the threat group was seen two years ago with a banking trojan disguised as Google or Chrome that also targeted Android device users around the globe. Researchers analyzed code from a campaign in April 2020 that downloaded the <e1>Fakespy</e1> version impersonating Taiwan’s Chungwha Post app. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers at Checkpoint spotted the malware and say it was hosted on apps created by Korean developers <e1>Kiniwini</e1>, registered as ENISTUDIO Corp. These included Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, Judy’s Happy House, and Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess. The Israeli firm says the Judy malware is "an auto-clicking adware" that makes money for its creators by falsifying clicks on online adverts. It adds that the malware is "definitely an illegitimate use of the users' mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks". Since the existence of Judy has been publicly disclosed, Google has removed all affected apps from the Play Store. During this sweep, Judy was found on 41 apps from <e2>Kiniwinia</e2> and nine apps from other creators in total. [SEP]

[CLS] Citizen Lab didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in <e1>Apple</e1> app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of Pegasus’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime messages or notifications. Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV. “Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,” according to Citizen Lab. KISMET likely doesn’t work against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections, Citizen Labs noted. Apple meanwhile is looking into the issue. Inside One Victim’s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, France, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers <e2>Aruba</e2>, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]
[CLS] Pegasus For Android: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, Lookout and <e1>Google</e1> are releasing research into the Android version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: Pegasus. A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets.

[CLS] After having revealed one of the ways that the company used to deliver its spyware on Android devices (fake app hosted on Google Play), Trend Micro researchers have analyzed the code of the actual spyware: RCS Android (<e1>Remote Control System Android</e1>). Unsurprisingly, it can do so many things and spy on so many levels that they consider it the most sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The spyware is delivered either via the aforementioned app, or via an SMS or email that contain a specially crafted URL that will trigger exploits for several vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to <e2>4.3 Jelly Bean</e2>. This will allow the attacker to gain root privilege, and allow the installation of a shell backdoor and RCS Android. [SEP]

[CLS] New Malware campaign <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> targeting Android Devices: Researchers Security researchers revealed an ongoing Android malware campaign dubbed ViceLeaker that has been active since 2016. According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named Triout. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The <e2>Moscow</e2>-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers note that XLoader has been found to have links with a <e2>Chinese hacker group</e2> called the Yanbian Gang. XLoader is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps. The malicious apps collect device owners’ personal information and financial information. XLoader distributed via DNS domains XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps. These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices. Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges. After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

[CLS] Then, on Monday evening, the C2 server disappeared and the currency converter on <e2>Google Play</e2> no longer contained the trojan malware. Avast has notified Google about the malicious app; Threatpost has reached out to Google for further comment on whether the app is still available on Google Play. “The version in Google Play currently does not contain the dropper code anymore – the app was updated with a new version, which is benign again,” David told Threatpost. “We can only speculate why the threat actors are doing this. It could be they are testing different options with this app, including whether and when Google or external cybersecurity researchers detect the malicious code. So far, we have not received a response from Google yet.” The Evolving Cerberus Threat Cerberus first emerged last August on underground forums, being offered in a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. Since then a newly discovered variant of the Cerberus Android trojan has been spotted, with vastly expanded and more sophisticated info-harvesting capabilities, and the ability to run TeamViewer. It’s only the latest malware family to be discovered on a legitimate app marketplace. In February, researchers identified eight malicious Android apps on Google Play distributing the “Haken” malware, which exfiltrates sensitive data from victims and covertly signs them up for expensive premium subscription services. And in April, a new spyware campaign dubbed <e1>PhantomLance</e1> was discovered being distributed via dozens of apps within Google Play. [SEP]
[CLS] 'Pegasus' iOS malware package also found to impact OS X, <e1>Apple</e1> issues patch Apple in a patch last week blocked a particularly nasty malware package called "Pegasus" from infiltrating iOS devices, and the company is now doing the same for its OS X desktop operating system. Apple on Thursday issued security updates for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Safari to address a vulnerability that potentially allows nefarious agents to take over a target device with a single click. Dubbed "Pegasus," the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more. Apple patched the vulnerability last week when it released iOS 9.3.5. It appears the same WebKit and kernel vulnerabilities that enable Pegasus to effectively infiltrate iOS devices also exist in OS X. To combat potential exposure, Apple issued a combined security update for OS X Yosemite and El Capitan, as well as a standalone fix for the Safari web browser. The combined OS X update includes the Safari patch. Pegasus was discovered by Citizen Lab and Lookout after a human rights activist was sent a link leading to a malicious webpage bearing the jailbreak and remote monitoring tools.

Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. Once downloaded, EventBot amasses a carte blanche of permissions, including starting at bootup and maintaining a persistent background process allowing the app to monitor the smartphone continuously. The trojan also prevents the phone from sleeping and ignores battery optimization settings. EventBot also obtains control of Android’s accessibility services to run a keylogger, receive notifications as well as retrieve the content of open windows. Although still in the development stage, the app may be a more significant threat to mobile banking compared to Anubis. Cybercriminals have discovered a lucrative target in the Android mobile banking and shopping industry.

[CLS] <e1>TangleBot</e1> Malware Reaches Deep into Android Device Functions The mobile baddie grants itself access to almost everything, enabling spying, data-harvesting, stalking and fraud attacks, among others. An Android malware called TangleBot has weaved its way onto the cyber-scene: One that researchers said can perform a bouquet of malicious actions, including stealing personal info and controlling apps and device functions. According to Cloudmark researchers, the newly discovered mobile malware is spreading via SMS messaging in the U.S. and Canada, using lures about COVID-19 boosters and regulations. The goal is to social-engineer targets into clicking on an embedded link, which takes them to a website.

[CLS] Researchers analyzed code from a campaign in April 2020 that downloaded the <e1>Fakespy</e1> version impersonating Taiwan’s Chungwha Post app. Once the user clicked on the malicious link, the app asked them to approve installation. The app’s PackageInstaller showed its permission access and asks for the user’s approval, which then installed the application. During installation, researchers observed FakeSpy gaining access to numerous permissions, including the ability to: read, write, send and receive SMS messages; open network sockets and access the internet; write to external storage; read from internal storage; and access information about networks to which the device is connected, among others. After installation, the app begins its “real malicious activity” by downloading a set of dynamic libraries from the libmsy.so file, which executes the packed mycode.jar file to load various insidious information-stealing capabilities into FakeSpy’s process onto the device, Almkias said. Once FakeSpy is on the device, it steals all contacts in the device’s contact list and their information, as well as the infected device’s data. That includes the mobile number, the device model, the OS version, and banking and cryptocurrency app information. It also asks to be the device’s default SMS app so the malware can spread to other devices. Researchers found that the postal apps used to disguise FakeSpy are country-specific, including: USPS, Chungwha Post, the British Royal Mail, the German Deutsche Post, France’s La Poste, Japan Post and <e2>Swiss Post</e2>. Roaming Mantis used the Android developer tool WebView to build the fake applications, which is what gives them their authenticity, Almkias said. [SEP]
[CLS] Postal Service, the <e1>U.K. Royal Mail</e1>, DHL Group, France's Las Poste, Taiwan's Chunghwa Post, several private delivery companies in Japan as well as others in Switzerland and Germany, Cybereason researchers say. If the recipient clicks on the links in these messages, malicious code is downloaded onto the Android device that installs the FakeSpy malware. The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday. FakeSpy has been active in the wild since at least 2017. Its operators have been refining the information stealer’s code over the last three years and adding capabilities, according to Cybereason. The latest version has a larger target list that includes the U.S. and Europe. "The threat actors are preying on unsuspecting victims because people tend to open emails and messages when it comes to their deliveries," Assaf Dahan, senior director and head of threat research at Cybereason, tells Information Security Media Group. "And one of the main communication methods of these companies - <e2>postal services</e2> and transportation services - is by SMS. [SEP]
[CLS] First Twitter‑controlled Android botnet discovered Detected by ESET as <e1>Android/Twitoor</e1>, this malware is unique because of its resilience mechanism. Instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server, it receives instructions via tweets. Android/Twitoor is a backdoor capable of downloading other malware onto an infected device. It has been active for around one month. This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of Android/Twitoor.A, can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or <e2>MMS application</e2> but without having their functionality. [SEP]
[CLS] Its name is AndroidOS/MalLocker.B. <e1>MalLocker.B</e1> is the youngest but shrewdest member of a ransomware family that has a long history of holding Android devices for ransom. Like most other mobile ransomware programs, it does not encrypt victims’ files. Instead, it uses several new tricks to render the phone unusable, making it one of the most advanced mobile malware programs around. Here’s what you need to know to keep your phone safe from the malevolent MalLocker.B. A Family History Only Hackers Would Be Proud Of MalLocker.B is the latest variant in a family of Android ransomware that is continually evolving. Like its predecessors, MalLocker.B displays a ransom note that covers the entire screen of infected devices. Everything underneath it cannot be seen or accessed, preventing victims from using their phones. Typically, the hackers design the ransom note so that it looks like a notice from a local police department. It informs the victims that they committed a crime and must pay a fine, after which it provides instruction on how to do so. In the past, cybercriminals created the ransom note by hacking the functionality behind the system alert window. The system alert window was always displayed in the foreground because it was designed to notify users about system alerts and errors. This made it ideal for the hackers’ purpose. Eventually, <e2>Google</e2> developers made several changes to the Android operating system that eliminated the threat from this attack vector. [SEP]
[CLS] X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on <e2>Google Play</e2> by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster’s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. IBM X-Force reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. Malicious apps are a blight that both store operators and developers work hard to limit. Still, it is a recurring problem: In 2017, X-Force mobile researchers reported numerous occasions on which financial malware had sneaked into the Google Play Store, with the <e1>BankBot</e1> Android malware family leading the pack.

The following screenshot shows the contacts being stolen and written in a local array, which is then sent to C&C: Uninstalling apps Uninstalling apps is another function favored by developers of Android spyware and malware. They tend to target any antivirus protections on the device and uninstall them, which increases the possibility of their malware persisting on the device. Following screenshot shows this functionality in action: Other functions In addition to the functionalities we’ve described, the SpyNote RAT was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware. SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C. The screenshot below shows SpyNote RAT scanning for Wi-Fi and enabling it if a known channel is found: Additional features - SpyNote RAT could click photos using the device's camera, based on commands from C&C. - There were two interesting sub-classes found inside Main Activity: Receiver and Sender. Receiver was involved in receiving commands from the Server and the main functionality of Sender was to send all the data collected to the C&C over Wi-Fi. - SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device’s location to identify the exact location of the victim.

[CLS] The problem for <e2>Play Store</e2> users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of Anubis 2 was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. During Q1 2019, actor maza-in vanished from the threat landscape, leaving existing customers without support and updates. Although exact details about the vanishing of the actor remain unclear at the time of writing, a chain of events confirms that some abnormal activity took place around Anubis and its author. On December 13 2018 maza-in announces the release of Anubis 2.5; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code. On January 16 2019 Anubis code is leaked in an underground forum (both backend code and unobfuscated APK). On February 14 2019 for the first time an Anubis sample seen targeting Russian banks only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator). On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor <e1>Aldesa</e1> (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. [SEP]
[CLS] Previously in 2015, we saw the <e2>Rootnik</e2> Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access. SpyDealer 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gain root privilege by abusing “Baidu Easy Root” as detailed below: Drops a customized su file named sux from assets to the app’s own data directory. Checks if the infected device is already rooted or not. If the root privilege is available, there is no need to escalate to root privilege. Checks the existence of the file /data/data/<package_name>/broot/raw.zip which contains all the rooting exploits. If there is no such file, the malware will download it from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip. The file integrity is then inspected by comparing the MD5 value of the downloaded file and the pre-calculated one from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/md5.txt. Unzips the downloaded file to the app’s data directory and attempt to gain root privilege by systematically executing the exploits one by one. Installs busybox and remounts system partition as read-write by running a sequence of shell commands with superuser permission. The downloaded file “raw.zip” contains the exploits from “Baidu Easy Root” version 2.8.3, which is depicted in Figure 4. Table 2 gives a full list of the exploits stolen by SpyDealer. For example, 022d251cf509c2f0 is an executable binary file observed in the <e1>“raw.zip”,</e1> and the original file in “Baidu Easy Root” is actually in gzip format. [SEP]

[CLS] The coup de grâce is a command built into the malware called "<e1>seppuku</e1>," named after a form of Japanese ritual suicide. That command would factory-wipe the device, erasing all trace of the malware as well as all user data. Because you were tricked into granted Mandrake administrative privileges, rebooting the device or uninstalling the first-stage app won't get rid of the core malware. "The only way to remove Mandrake is to boot the device in safe mode, remove the device administrator special permission and uninstall it manually," Bitdefender wrote. Because that's where the money is Advertisement Such sophisticated abilities, and such targeted attacks, are normally the sure signs of a state-controlled espionage operation. But the Bitdefender researchers think this was a purely criminal-controlled money grab, even if the operators do appear to be located in Russia. Following the standard pattern of Russian malware, Mandrake won't infect Android users in Russia or former Soviet republics. But it also avoids all of Africa, any Arabic-speaking country and many poor nations in other regions. For unknown reasons, it also avoids installing itself on phones with <e2>Verizon</e2> SIM cards, or SIM cards from a top Chinese cellular carrier. [SEP]
[CLS] <e2>Check Point</e2> researchers discovered another widespread malware campaign on Google Play, Google’s official app store. The malware, dubbed “Judy”, is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a Korean company. The malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements, generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it. The malicious apps reached an astonishing spread between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads. Some of the apps we discovered resided on Google Play for several years, but all were recently updated. It is unclear how long the malicious code existed inside the apps, hence the actual spread of the malware remains unknown. We also found several apps containing the malware, which were developed by other developers on Google Play. The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, and it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly. The oldest app of the second campaign was last updated in April 2016, meaning that the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play store undetected. These apps also had a large amount of downloads between 4 and 18 million, meaning the total spread of the malware may have reached between 8.5 and 36.5 million users. Similar to previous malware which infiltrated Google Play, such as FalseGuide and <e1>Skinner</e1>, Judy relies on the communication with its Command and Control server (C&C) for its operation. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> Now Disguised As Netflix App A new version of the SpyNote Trojan is designed to trick Android users into thinking it’s a legitimate Netflix application. A new version of the SpyNote Trojan is designed to trick Android users into thinking it’s a legitimate Netflix application. Once installed, the remote access Trojan (RAT) essentially hands control of the device over to the hacker, enabling them to copy files, view contacts, and eavesdrop on the victim, among other capabilities. The malware is a new twist on the SpyNote RAT, a Trojan first uncovered on the dark web last summer by Palo Alto Networks. The most recent iteration, a product of the SpyNote Trojan builder, mimics a Netflix app and was discovered recently by researchers with Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ. Deepen Desai, Zscaler’s senior director of security research and operations, told Threatpost Tuesday that while researchers haven’t seen this particular RAT variant being spammed in the wild yet, they did see it on one of their threat feeds. According to the firm, after opening the malicious app, the icon disappears from the home screen but gets to work contacting its command and control server. It also uninstalls any antivirus protections a user may have set up on the device, in hopes of evading detection. Perhaps the malware’s most troubling capability, SpyNote allows the attacker to execute commands. “Command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim’s device. Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day,” Shivang Desai, a researcher with the firm wrote Tuesday. When it comes to surveillance, the RAT can take screen captures – and by taking advantage of the way the device handles audio – record conversations. According to researchers the malware hijacks the MediaProjection.Callback API, something first introduced in <e2>Android 5.0 Lollipop</e2>, to record audio. [SEP]

Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities <e2>Razdel</e2> (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] <e1>DualToy</e1> Windows Trojan Attacks Android, iOS Devices Researchers have found a malware family called DualToy that infects Windows PCs and sideloads malware onto connected Android and iOS devices. A Windows Trojan called DualToy has been discovered that can side load malicious apps onto Android and iOS devices via a USB connection from an infected computer. Researchers from Palo Alto Networks said DualToy has been in existence since January 2015, and it originally was limited to installing unwanted apps and displaying mobile ads on Android devices. About six months later, the Trojan morphed and began targeting iOS devices by installing a third-party App Store in hopes of nabbing iTunes usernames and passwords. “When DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android devices… We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015. Later in <e2>2016</e2>, a new variant appeared,” wrote senior malware researcher Claud Xiao in a technical description of the Trojan. [SEP]

The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year.

Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV Hotstar Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come. Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same SpyNote Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild. A complete list of sample hashes is available here. Conclusion The days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone. Nowadays, script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc. Moreover, there are many toolkits like the SpyNote Trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few clicks.

[CLS] First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. <e2>Security Without Borders</e2> has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features.

[CLS] Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, <e2>Check Point</e2> warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year.

[CLS] 0 Android Trojan that first came to light last year is being advertised on underground sites for anyone to rent. <e1>Red Alert</e1> is capable of stealing tons of sensitive information from infected mobile devices including SMS messages, contact details, information about WiFi networks, call logs, and data about current or recently running tasks. It can also initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm, block calls from banks and connect with bots via Twitter in case its command and control server (C&C) happens to go offline. Researchers said the malware has a UI to enable the device admin access, and does not allow the user to disable it once enabled. “The malware sets itself up as a default telephony provider, mostly for intercepting SMS messages,” researchers said. “A list of phone numbers to be intercepted can be controlled by the C&C server. Messages from these numbers may be hidden from the user. Intercepted messages are also sent to the C&C server. This could be used for intercepting 2 factor authentication codes used by most services these days including online banking.” Once the malware has full access to the infected device, it can even wipe out all data from the device. The malware is shipped via spam emails delivering .APK (Android Package Kit) attachments and it targets Android devices running Android marshmallow and later. Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” Red Alerts 2.0 malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the U.S, U.K, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, India and Italy, according to researchers. It is also being advertised for rent on underground forums starting at $200 for a week, $500 for a month and $999 for two months. The developer behind Red Alert 2.0 also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Viber, Skype, Uber and more.

[CLS] 400 Banks’ Customers Targeted with <e1>Anubis</e1> Trojan The new campaign masqueraded as an Orange Telecom account management app to deliver the latest iteration of Anubis banking malware. Customers of Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Capital One, along with nearly 400 other financial institutions, are being targeted by a malicious app disguised to look like the official account management platform for French telecom company Orange S.A. Researchers say this is just the beginning. Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan Anubis – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at Lookout warned in a new report. And it’s not just customers of big banks at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted. Infosec Insiders Newsletter “As a banking trojan malware, Anubis’ goal is to collect significant data about the victim from their mobile device for financial gain,” the Lookout report said. “This is done by intercepting SMSs, keylogging, file exfiltration, screen monitoring, GPS data collection and abuse of the device’s accessibility services.” The malicious version of the Orange Telecom account management app was submitted to the <e2>Google Play store</e2> in July 2021 and later removed, but the researchers warned that they believe this campaign was just a test of Google’s antivirus protections and will likely resurface soon.

[CLS] <e1>Ginp</e1> Android trojan targets banking apps & threatens 2FA/SMS Dubbed Ginp; the trojan keeps coming back with new capabilities. Researchers at ThreatFabric, the cybersecurity firm based in Amsterdam, have been following an “interesting new strain of banking malware” dubbed Ginp distributed as Adobe Flash Player. Identified firstly by Kaspersky’s Android malware analyst Tatyana Shishkova in late October; Ginp is currently targeting users in the UK and Spain. Researchers opine that the Trojan was actually launched in June 2019 and is yet under the active development phase. According to researchers, cybercriminals have released at least five different versions of Ginp in the past five months, which reflects how eagerly cybercriminals are vying to improvise this Trojan. ThreatFabric analysts claim that Ginp is unique because its codebase was developed from scratch and is being expanded continuously through updates. Its target list is also considerably narrow as its main targets are the banks in Spain. The code of Gino has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis. Researchers further claim that there are striking similarities between the codes of both <e2>Trojans</e2> but it cannot be said that Ginp is the replica of Anubis rather it is inspired by Anubis.

[CLS] <e1>Anubis II</e1> - malware and afterlife Introduction Besides being the Egyptian God associated with mummification and afterlife, Anubis is also an Android banking malware that has caused quite some trouble for over 300 financial institutions worldwide since 2017. Anubis II is the Android banking Trojan created and advertised by an actor with the nickname “maza-in”. This malware family goes beyond the well-known overlay attacks by combining advanced features such as screen streaming, remote file browsing, sound recording, keylogging and even a network proxy, making it an efficient banking malware but also a potential spying tool. Effectively, Anubis can be considered one of the most used Android <e2>banking Trojans</e2> since late 2017. [SEP]
[CLS] Christoph Scholz/Flickr, CC BY-SA Since 2019, <e1>Pegasus</e1> users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user’s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything. All that is required for a successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or operating system installed on the device. This is known as a zero-click exploit. Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts. It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance without the permission or knowledge of the user. Who has been using Pegasus and why NSO Group says it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the Mexican government in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. However, much of the recent reporting about Pegasus centers around a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The list has been attributed to NSO Group, but the list’s origins are unclear. A statement from Amnesty International in <e2>Israel</e2> stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients, though it’s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. [SEP]
[CLS] He added that: “The disclosure on <e1>TangleBot</e1> was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission’s New Media and Information Security Department by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT). TangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur.” Over the years, fraudsters have used different types of malware such as Pegasus, Medusa, etc. to infiltrate the devices of unsuspecting users to steal their personal information, undermine enterprises, and retrieve financial details. However, TangleBot is said to possess a more evasive and elusive nature. How TangleBot operates The TangleBot malware is distributed via a text message to mainly Android users. In order to gain access to the user’s device, the fraudsters send messages that are familiar to the user and implore them to read more or find more detailed information by clicking a provided link. When users click the provided link, the TangleBot malware takes over the device, providing the fraudsters access to financial information, personal information, etc. Worthy of note is the malware’s ability to use advanced behaviors and transmission capabilities. This means that it tries to send messages that will interest the targeted user. For example, coronavirus related information or bonanza or gifts. In addition, other things the malware can do in an infected device include Recording the audio, screen, or both, then streaming them to another device. Placing overlay screens on the device, to obscure apps and screens. Silently, calling contacts and blocking calls. Sending and receiving text messages. Deploying further device observation or espionage capabilities The Nature of TangleBot While other types of Malware are internet based, capitalizing on <e2>social media apps</e2> to lure users, TangleBot only operates as text messages.

[CLS] Dubbed <e1>Spynote</e1> by the researcher, the trojan targets those users who install apps in APK format, the process of downloading apps in APK format on Android devices is known as “sideloading” which is only possible if the user has allowed “Unknown Sources” in their security settings. The SpyNote RAT was found being discussed on several underground hacking forums by the researchers which, after analyzing turned out to be a bigger threat than expected. Upon scanning, it was discovered that SpyNote doesn’t require root access in order to take full control of an infected device. Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that’s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won’t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card. The researchers also found SpyNote’s sample scanned on VirusTotal. The Unit 42 also noted that SpyNot OmniRat and DroidJack. OmniRat was detected in 2015 targeting MAC, Windows or Andriod operating system while DroidJack RAT was found also found in fake Pokémon Go apps on Android store. Here is a video presentation demonstrating how SpyNote RAT works: Currently, SpyNote is not present in Google Play Store but it’s only a matter of time before it will begin bypassing the Google’s Bouncer system. However, if you are into downloading apps from a third party website just stop, download apps from Google <e2>Play Store</e2> and keep your Android devices updated to the latest OS version. [SEP]
[CLS] An investigation of Chrysaor Malware on Android <e2>Google</e2> is constantly working to improve our systems that protect users from Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs). Usually, PHA authors attempt to install their harmful apps on as many devices as possible. However, a few PHA authors spend substantial effort, time, and money to create and install their harmful app on one or a very small number of devices. This is known as a targeted attack. In this blog post, we describe Chrysaor, a newly discovered family of spyware that was used in a targeted attack on a small number of Android devices, and how investigations like this help Google protect Android users from a variety of threats. What is Chrysaor? Chrysaor is spyware believed to be created by NSO Group Technologies, specializing in the creation and sale of software and infrastructure for targeted attacks. Chrysaor is believed to be related to the Pegasus spyware that was first identified on iOS and analyzed by Citizen Lab and <e1>Lookout</e1>. Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to Pegasus, which we named Chrysaor.

[CLS] Fortunately for us, after a while topics showing interest in a certain “Alien” malware started to appear in the underground forum and the author himself confirmed his affiliation to, and the name of, the Trojan: Based on our in-depth knowledge of the Trojan (available in our Mobile Threat Intelligence portal), we can prove that the <e1>Alien</e1> malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early January 2020 and rented out at the same time as Cerberus. Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters. Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in <e2>May 2020</e2>, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app. [SEP]
[CLS] We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running <e2>Facebook</e2> profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families. What it does The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The chat application acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app. At the time of writing Lookout has observed two updates to the <e1>Dardesh</e1> application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28.

[CLS] , and Italy using cloud providers <e2>Aruba</e2>, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that <e1>Monarchy</e1> spied on,” Citizen Lab noted.

[CLS] Researchers note that XLoader has been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called the <e1>Yanbian</e1> Gang. XLoader is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps. The malicious apps collect device owners’ personal information and financial information. XLoader distributed via DNS domains XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps. These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices. Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges. After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a <e2>security app</e2> for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.

And it gets worse. Polipo proxy and Man-in-the-Middle Attack The attackers behind Mazar BOT also implemented the “Polipo proxy“, which gives them additional access to even more Android functionalities. An even higher degree of compromise: Chrome injects As if it weren’t enough that it can stop calls and launch other aggressive commands on the victim’s phone, Mazar BOT is also capable of injecting itself into Chrome. And there are several other settings and commands that Mazar BOT can trigger, as showcased below. These include: Controlling the phone’s keys Enabling the sleep mode Save actions in the phone’s settings, etc. Mazar BOT won’t run on Russian Android smartphones Our team was not surprised to observe that the malware cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with the Russian language option. Mazar BOT will check the phone to identify the victim’s country and this will stop the malicious APK if the targeted phone turns out to be owned by a Russian user: locale.getCountry () equalsIgnoreCase ( “RU”)) Process.killProcess (Process.myPid ()); Until now, Mazar BOT has been advertised for sale on several websites on the <e1>Dark Web</e1>, but this is the first time we’ve seen this code be abused in active attacks.

[CLS] Names like Anubis, Hydra, Ginp, or <e1>Gustuff</e1> appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. However, the one that has dominated the arena this year –for several reasons– is Cerberus: a nightmare-inducing rodent. Cerberus, the king of all RATs Cerberus is a highly sophisticated Android malware, in circulation since 2019. It has been actively distributed on dark web forums, in a “malware-as-a-service” (MaaS) format. For a sum between $4,000 and $12,000, cybercriminal groups capable of paying it have had all the malware tools at their disposal. And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. Cerberus was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing Anubis’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the banking apps inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. Like any <e2>Remote Access Trojan</e2> worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside.

[CLS] <e1>TrickBot</e1> App Bypasses Non-SMS Banking 2FA TrickBot victims are being fooled into downloading an app that records their screens – stealing non-SMS 2FA passcodes for banking websites. The TrickBot trojan has a new trick up its sleeve for bypassing a new kind of two-factor authentication (2FA) security method used by banks – by fooling its victims into downloading a malicious Android app. The app, which researchers dubbed “TrickMo,” is still under active development. While TrickMo is being currently deployed against TrickBot victims in Germany, researchers say that it can be used to target any bank or region — and they expect to see frequent changes and updates in the future. “Though it’s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps, and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app,” said Pavel Asinovsky, malware researcher with IBM X-Force, in a Tuesday analysis. Researchers first discovered the mobile app after a September 2019 tweet by <e2>CERT-Bund</e2> flagging TrickBot using man-in-the-browser techniques. [SEP]

[CLS] ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an <e2>Android</e2> malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after banking app users. Trend Micro mobile threat analyst Tony Bao discovered a variant of Anubis (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_AnubisDropper) of the same type a few months ago. The Anubis variant analyzed in <e1>Bao</e1>’s research targeted 188 banking- and finance-related apps. [SEP]

[CLS] Cerberus was spread via a fake website that asked users to install <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2>." Stefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used "a web framework where anyone can check website visit statistics—because of that I found out which countries are targeted with actual number of site visits." Over a fourteen day period, Stefanko tracked more than 13,000 visits to the fake Cerberus website, most of which were from users in the U.S. and Japan. At about the same time, Cerberus was seen being rented out in underground forums by the team at ThreatFabric. The malware's developers claimed it had been used privately for two years beforehand, and that it was "written from scratch" and does not "borrow" code from existing malware, making it harder to detect.

[CLS] The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using <e1>Anubis</e1> in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, <e2>Asia</e2> and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

[CLS] Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1> suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich. Rather, it was downloaded later when the user was interacting with the app. With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. Andrew Blaich, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while ViperRAT apps had about a thousand combined installs. What those may seem like a low numbers, <e2>Blaich</e2> said Desert Scorpion "is a part of a targeted attack and not used for broad global-wide surveillance," and that "this number is in line with what we would expect.

[CLS] <e1>Cerberus</e1> Banking Trojan Unleashed on Google Play The Cerberus malware can steal banking credentials, bypass security measures and access text messages. A malicious Android app has been uncovered on the Google Play app marketplace that is distributing the banking trojan, Cerberus. The app has 10,000 downloads. Researchers said that the trojan was found within the last few days, as it was being spread via a Spanish currency converter app (called “Calculadora de Moneda”), which has been available to Android users in Spain since March. Once executed, the malware has the capabilities to steal victims’ bank-account credentials and bypass security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA). “As is common with banking malware, Cerberus disguised itself as a genuine app in order to access the banking details of unsuspecting users,” Ondrej David, with Avast, said in a <e2>Tuesday</e2> analysis.

[CLS] Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and <e2>Japanese</e2> speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. <e1>Deutsche Post</e1> - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn.

[CLS] One pitch document from <e1>NSO</e1>’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent <e2>Jamal Khashoggi</e2> before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. [SEP]
[CLS] Governments and companies such as the <e1>NSO Group</e1> that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there’s no guarantee others won’t discover the same problems, some say. “Government use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,” said Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. “It's not like terrorists are using different phones from the rest of us.” Apple devices have long had a reputation for security, according to Forrester Research principal analyst Jeff Pollard — one highlighted earlier this year when the company faced down the FBI in a legal battle over an encrypted iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. The FBI was eventually able to break into the phone without Apple’s assistance after paying still-unknown professional hackers more than a million dollars for help. Still, Apple remains a leader when it comes to delivering secure consumer products — in part because the company keeps tight control over the iPhone platform, according to Citizen Lab researchers Bill Marczak and <e2>John Scott-Railton</e2>. But that’s also made new vulnerabilities valuable to people who want to break into Apple products. [SEP]
[CLS] The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and <e2>Turkmenistani</e2> mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers. Researchers said that a company called <e1>eSurv S.R.L</e1>. was also involved. [SEP]

[CLS] Similar to previous malware which infiltrated Google Play, such as FalseGuide and <e1>Skinner</e1>, Judy relies on the communication with its Command and Control server (C&C) for its operation. After Check Point notified Google about this threat, the apps were swiftly removed from the Play store. How Judy operates: To bypass Bouncer, Google Play’s protection, the hackers create a seemingly benign bridgehead app, meant to establish connection to the victim’s device, and insert it into the app store. Once a user downloads a malicious app, it silently registers receivers which establish a connection with the C&C server. The server replies with the actual malicious payload, which includes JavaScript code, a user-agent string and URLs controlled by the malware author. The malware opens the URLs using the user agent that imitates a PC browser in a hidden webpage and receives a redirection to another website. Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure. Upon clicking the ads, the malware author receives payment from the website developer, which pays for the illegitimate clicks and traffic. The JavaScript code locates the targeted ads by searching for iframes which contain ads from Google ads infrastructure, as shown in the image below: The fraudulent clicks generate a large revenue for the perpetrators, especially since the malware reached a presumably wide spread. Who is behind Judy? The malicious apps are all developed by a Korean company named Kiniwini, registered on Google Play as ENISTUDIO corp. The company develops mobile apps for both <e2>Android</e2> and iOS platforms. [SEP]

In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, <e2>France</e2>, U. [SEP]
[CLS] Hamas-linked spyware targeting Palestinians removed from Google Play store A hacking group which analysts believe is linked to Hamas successfully placed highly targeted surveillanceware in the Google Play Store in order to spy on <e2>Palestinian</e2> targets, according to new research from the mobile security firm Lookout. The newly identified malware, known as Desert Scorpion, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in Palestine. A similar 2017 campaign from the same “highly active” group, dubbed APT-C-23. The group has been linked to Hamas’s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students. Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after <e1>Lookout</e1> notified Google on April 3. [SEP]
[CLS] Ursnif Leverages <e1>Cerberus</e1> to Automate Fraudulent Bank Transfers in Italy June 23, 2021 IBM Trusteer researchers continually monitor the evolution and attack tactics in the banking sector. In a recent analysis, our team found that an Ursnif (aka Gozi) banking Trojan variant is being used in the wild to target online banking users in Italy with mobile malware. Aside from the Ursnif infection on the victim’s desktop, the malware tricks victims into fetching a mobile app from a fake Google Play page and infects their mobile device with the Cerberus Android malware. The Cerberus malware component of the attack is used by Ursnif’s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks to their users when account updates and money transfer transactions are being confirmed in real-time. Cerberus also possesses other features and can enable the attacker to obtain the lock-screen code and remotely control the device. Cerberus is an overlay-type mobile malware that emerged in mid-2019 but initially lacked advanced capabilities. It has evolved over time to eventually feature the ability to hijack SMS content and control devices remotely, alongside other sophisticated data theft features. Cerberus was peddled in the underground as commodity malware until the summer of 2020, taking over the market share of <e2>Anubis</e2>, a previous pay-per-use malware. [SEP]
[CLS] During one session, the C2 server commanded our emulated device to send four different SMS messages to four different phone numbers, all of which were associated with <e2>Russian</e2> financial institutions. At least three of the messages were intended to check a user’s account balance at the institution (we could not confirm the purpose of the fourth).Through additional research, we identified several forum posts where victims complained of funds (up to 600 rubles) were transferred out of their accounts after RuMMS infected their phones. We do not know exactly how many people have been infected with RuMMS malware. However, our data suggests that there have been at least 2,729 infections between January 2016 and early April 2016, with a peak in March of more than 1,100 infections.

[CLS] This security threat has been named as the <e1>Tangle Bot</e1> due to its ability to takeover a number of device’s functions that may include contact list, phone history, camera and microphone along with the ability to use Internet. This malware works same as the Flu Bot threat which is still out there in the United Kingdom as well as in Europe. Just like the name Tangle, this malware can mislead the target to install the tampered software received by a forged Covid-19 alert. This alert contains information about booster available for Covid-19 vaccine along with the new regulatory policies. With the ongoing pandemic, which has already created panic, such types of messages can fuel up the target and will somehow trick them to click on the link attached with the message believing that the link will provide more information regarding Boosters as well the governmental policies for Covid-19. After tapping the highlighted link, the web display will show that the <e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2> needs to be updated, if the user agrees to update it by tapping the installation button for update, TangleBot will be installed and will start taking over functions including getting control on phone book, recording screen, opening device camera and mic whenever the attacker wants too.

[CLS] Another app takes two malware types, called <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker "a considerable amount of control over a compromised device." The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to <e2>Hamas</e2>, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. [SEP]
[CLS] Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group APT-C-23, also known as <e1>Two-Tailed Scorpion</e1> and Desert Scorpion. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram. The malware, Android/SpyC32.A, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in <e2>2017</e2> by several security research teams.

[CLS] A new <e2>Android</e2> Trojan called SpyNote has been identified by researchers who warn that attacks are forthcoming. The Trojan, found by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. <e1>Droidjack</e1> made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan.

[CLS] As the team at Scandinavian security group CSIS describes, malware known as MazarBOT is being distributed via SMS in <e2>Denmark</e2> and is likely to also be encountered in other countries. Victims’ first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their Android smartphone receives. The txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable Android application. CSIS provided a (sanitised) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for: “You have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link http://www.mmsforyou[.]net/mms.apk to view the message” Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, MazarBOT downloads a copy of Tor onto users’ Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim’s location to an Iranian mobile phone number. With the malware now in place, a number of actions can be performed, including allowing attackers to secretly monitor and control smartphones via a backdoor, send messages to premium-rate numbers, and intercept two-factor authentication codes sent by online banking apps and the like. In fact, with full access to the compromised Android smartphone, the opportunities for criminals to wreak havoc are significant – such as erasing infected phones or launching man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In its analysis, CSIS notes that MazarBOT was reported by <e1>Recorded Future</e1> last November as being actively sold in Russian underground forums and intriguingly, the malware will not activate on Android devices configured with Russian language settings.

[CLS] Throughout <e2>2017</e2>, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] Lookout notified <e2>Google</e2> of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, <e2>Facebook</e2>, Twitter, Viber, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.

[CLS] After finding Gooligan in August, and noting its alarming success rate, Check Point and <e2>Google</e2> formed a task force to deal with the threat. Check Point today released a free tool to check for infection. In a blog post, it also provided a list of apps containing the malicious Gooligan code. Shaulov believes there's a good chance the community effort will lead to Gooligan's demise, though he wouldn't reveal the names of those he believed to be involved. "Hopefully we’ll be able to bring this operation to its end," he told me. "I’m not sure I can say exactly who it is but I can probably say who is involved." No user data theft, says Google It does not appear the hackers are actually using the account credentials to pilfer user data. Google's Android security chief, Adrian Ludwig, posted a blog about Gooligan today, saying the company had not seen any evidence of other fraudulent activity on the stolen accounts, outside of the promotion of apps. "The motivation behind Ghost Push is to promote apps, not steal information, and that held true for this variant," said Ludwig. All affected users have been notified and had their account login tokens reset. They've also been provided with clear guidelines on how to login securely, Ludwig added. Apps associated with Ghost Push activity have been removed from Google Play too. As Shaulov indicated, it appears a coordinated effort to take down the Ghost Push operation is well under way. "We are working with the <e1>Shadowserver Foundation</e1> and multiple major ISPs that provided infrastructure used to host and control the malware. [SEP]
[CLS] The <e2>Dardesh</e2> app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family Desert Scorpion. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. “The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,” the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed APT-C-23 to be behind this scheme. “Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers,” they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the <e1>FrozenCell</e1> family attributed to APT-C-23. [SEP]
[CLS] , and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, <e2>CloudSigma</e2> and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and <e1>Center-2</e1>, spied on one and three phones, respectively.

ERMAC differs from Cerberus in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm. “Despite the usage of different obfuscation techniques and new method of string encryption – using Blowfish encryption algorithm, we can definitely state that ERMAC is another Cerberus-based trojan.” reads the analysis published by Threatfabric. “Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts. clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device At the time of writing, ThreatFabric researchers with the help of support @malwrhunterteam experts determine that ERMAC is only targeting Poland, where is being distributed under the guise of delivery service and government applications. The new banking trojan can target over three hundred <e2>banking and mobile apps</e2>. “The story of ERMAC shows one more time how malware source code leaks can lead not only to slow evaporation of the malware family but also bring new threats/actors to the threat landscape.

[CLS] According to Cloudmark researchers, the newly discovered mobile malware is spreading via SMS messaging in the <e2>U.S.</e2> and Canada, using lures about COVID-19 boosters and regulations. The goal is to social-engineer targets into clicking on an embedded link, which takes them to a website. The site tells users they need an “Adobe Flash update.” If they click on the subsequent dialog boxes, TangleBot malware installs. In propagation and theme, TangleBot resembles other mobile malware, such as the FluBot SMS malware that targets the U.K. and Europe or the <e1>CovidLock</e1> Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients.

[CLS] <e1>Android</e1> 'Gooligan' Hackers Just Scored The Biggest Ever Theft Of Google Accounts A new variant of Android malware is responsible for what's believed to be the biggest single theft of Google accounts on record. The so-called Gooligan strain has infected as many as 1.3 million Android phones since August, completely prising the devices open and stealing the tokens users are given to verify they are authorized to access accounts. Its main aim, though, is not to pilfer all that juicy data in Gmail or Docs, but to force users into downloading apps as part of a huge advertising fraud scheme, making as much as $320,000 a month. And Gooligan is spreading at an alarming rate: since the start of this month, it's been racking up an average of 13,000 new infections every day, according to researchers from Check Point. The malicious software first gains a foothold on devices when users visit a website and download a third-party app. Michael Shaulov, head of mobile and cloud Security Check Point, said that might be a porn site, or a third-party app store, where visitors are encouraged to download software to get access to content. But once downloaded, Gooligan determines which Android phone it's infected and launches the appropriate exploits to "root" the device -- i.e. take complete control over it. To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as <e2>VROOT</e2> and Towelroot, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, KitKat and Lollipop. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers say they have observed 8,000 unique samples of the <e1>DualToy</e1> variant to date, and add they can’t be sure how many mobile devices have been infected by the malware. Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e2>ZergHelper</e2>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]
[CLS] NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. <e2>NSO Group</e2> has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and <e1>Mexican NGOs</e1> have also reported that the Mexican government has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes.

[CLS] mobeebom has been promoting the <e1>MobiHok RAT</e1> through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since January 2019. MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In <e2>July 2016</e2>, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like OmniRat and DroidJack, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum.

[CLS] FakeSpy Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> threat group infect Android users with the FakeSpy infostealer. Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, <e2>Switzerland</e2>, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.

All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company.

Also, the C&C infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families. “The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the Google Play Store, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like Pegasus or <e1>FinFisher</e1>,” the researchers pointed out.

[CLS] The Android app, called "<e1>TrickMo</e1>" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware. "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," IBM researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious Ryuk ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials. Abusing Android's Accessibility Features to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the <e2>CERT-Bund</e2> last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices.

[CLS] Once <e1>Gooligan</e1> has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year. The initial warnings about Ghost Push landed in September last year, and Google said in April it was the most successful Android malware of 2015, infecting around 4 million phones in its various forms. It also rooted devices and displayed malicious ads. In <e2>October</e2>, security firm Cheetah Mobile Security said thredifferent versions of Ghost Push were propagating at a rate of 10,000 installs a day. [SEP]

[CLS] To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as VROOT and <e2>Towelroot</e2>, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, KitKat and Lollipop. Together, those operating systems account for 74 per cent of Android devices in use today, totalling around 1.03 billion. Most infections (40 per cent) are in Asia, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in North America, Shaulov said. Another 12 per cent are based in Europe.

[CLS] The most notable method of loading the code was via an iframe that was observed on the Chinese-language version of the <e2>Uighur Times</e2> website. The following code was observed. Here, the entire iframe has been obfuscated by using base64 encoding, which is a common method to embed images in the source of websites. However, it is far less common to see an iframe load content from a remote website; this may be used as an indicator of suspect activity. The base64 content in this iframe decodes as follows: Targeting Website Visitors The index.html file hosted on cdn.doublesclick[.]me would kick off the first step in potential targeting against the user. The response returned by the server would depend on the User-Agent of the visitor making the request. An exploit chain would be kicked off if the right User-Agent string was detected; otherwise, the server would simply respond with the text "ok". As an example, the following User-Agent strings would result in the exploit chain being launched. Note that exploit can be triggered through any browser on the phone, as they all use WebKit. Volexity was able to confirm successful explotiation of a phone running 12.3.1 via the Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge mobile browsers. If a visiting device passes the first checks put in place by Evil Eye, code similar to the following would be returned: The file jquery.js contains the main logic and the server's public key, while the file s.js contains the supporting Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library used to generate a client key pair. This client public key is passed as a variable into the loading of the final JavaScript. If each step of the JavaScript above is successful, it results in a Mach-O binary running on the phone.

[CLS] The security company says one million Google accounts have been compromised this way since <e2>August</e2>, in what it believes is the largest Google account breach to date. Google users can use Check Point's Gooligan-checker to see if their account has been compromised. Rather than use those tokens to steal information, Gooligan-infected devices are designed to go about fraudulently earning their operators ad revenue. Check Point estimates that two million apps have been installed this way over the past three months. These apps earn attackers money in two ways: each app install results in a payment to the attacker, while apps also earn revenue from ad services that pay to distribute ads through installed apps. To feed the scheme, the malware also forces infected devices to leave positive reviews and a high rating on Google Play. Android security lead Adrian Ludwig said in a blog that Google had found no evidence that the user data has been accessed, adding that the main objective of the malware, which is a variant of the already known <e1>Ghost Pus</e1>h, is to promote apps rather than steal information.

[CLS] Another app takes two malware types, called <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker "a considerable amount of control over a compromised device." The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. <e2>Lookout</e2> said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target.

[CLS] Effectively, <e1>Anubis</e1> can be considered one of the most used Android banking Trojans since late 2017. As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as online banking credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e2>“Android.BankBot.149.origin”</e2>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. [SEP]

[CLS] Logs collected by Check Point researchers show that every day <e1>Gooligan</e1> installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages. After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign’s Command and Control (C&C) server. Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware <e2>HummingBad</e2>. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user’s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install adware to generate revenue Ad servers, which don’t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play.

[CLS] However, <e1>Ginp</e1> also provides attackers with the flexibility to initiate an overlay attack at any time without relying on the user. For example, an attacker can trigger the overlay as soon as the user sees the fake SMS message or push notification. Evolving New Features The Ginp malware continues to evolve rapidly, with developers frequently releasing new features. Several of these features are worth mentioning. Fake SMS Push Notifications This new feature was added December 2019. It is used for faking an incoming SMS message or push notification from the victim’s bank. These techniques allow the attacker to employ social engineering before initiating an overlay attack and help decrease suspicion from a victim. Notifications Listener (Blocker) Service A few months ago, Ginp developers introduced a new feature that allows the malware to block all push notifications from legitimate applications. This is particularly helpful to attackers, as it can block notifications about the fraudulent transaction taking place, thus avoiding arousing suspicion from the victim. Additionally, the content of the blocked notification is sent to the C&C server, allowing malware operators to steal second-factor authentication codes or collect <e2>social media</e2> and instant messaging notifications to spy on the target.

More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and <e1>Center-2</e1>, spied on one and three phones, respectively.

[CLS] <e1>Alien</e1> - the story of Cerberus' demise Intro As predicted in our blog 2020 – year of the RAT, 2020 has been an effervescent year for financially motivated threat actors making use of Android malware. Although the ThreatFabric team discovered several new banking Trojans, it also observed the death of some others. Threat actors continue to innovate and try out new ways to steal and monetize personal information. In some cases, actors are successful, with long-running campaigns powered by their malware, in other cases, they are fruitless, resulting in the downfall of their malware, as quickly as it appeared. In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known Android banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed Alien, and explain how it relates to infamous Cerberus malware, who’s service has recently been discontinued. The preface, Cerberus August 2020 marked the demise of Cerberus, the most successful Android banking Trojan service, or MaaS (Malware as a Service), of the last 12 months. Details about the Trojan can be found in our blog about from <e2>August last year</e2>. Apparently due to issues related to shortcomings of the staff within the threat actor’s technical team, architectural and technical issues with the Trojan remained unsolved long enough for Google Play Protect to detect all related samples on the spot on all infected devices, of course resulting in unhappy customers.

[CLS] Such overlays are designed around specific apps, and <e1>Cerberus</e1> has developed more than 30 of these thus far. Of note, the target banks are in the U.S., France and Japan—a fairly specific list of countries. ESET security researcher Lukas Stefanko told me he "found Cerberus in June, a couple of days after it was published on an underground forum." Stefanko used Twitter to ask the research community if anyone had come across it before, "and that is when I noticed their twitter handle joined the debate under my tweet." "Even though they know I am android malware analyst," Stefanko told me, "they tried to sell me their Cerberus bot. They created a profile where the only thing I needed to do is buy it. However my goal was to obtain working sample and C&C address to properly analyze it." The developers sent Stefanko a sample of Cerberus, but used his Twitter handle "instead of a real C&C server," and so he was unable to test it. Two days later, Stefanko and colleagues "detected an active campaign using this new banking Trojan with thousands of website visits that contained the payload. Cerberus was spread via a fake website that asked users to install Adobe Flash Player." Stefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used "a web framework where anyone can check website visit statistics—because of that I found out which countries are targeted with actual number of site visits." Over a fourteen day period, Stefanko tracked more than 13,000 visits to the fake Cerberus website, most of which were from users in the U.S. and Japan. At about the same time, Cerberus was seen being rented out in underground forums by the team at ThreatFabric. The malware's developers claimed it had been used privately for two years beforehand, and that it was "written from scratch" and does not "borrow" code from existing malware, making it harder to detect. There is certainly none of the leaked <e2>Anubis</e2> source code within Cerberus. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Anubis</e1> Android Malware Is Back and It Is Focusing on Financial Institutions The Most Recent Operations Affects Roughly 400 Targets. In a recent malware operation, the Anubis Android banking malware is targeting clients of approximately 400 banking institutions. The cybercriminals are attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency wallets, and digital payment systems by posing as an Orange S.A. Android application intended to collect information such as: browsing cookies, passwords saved on browsers, credit card details. More on Anubis Malware Anubis is a mobile malware that affects Android smartphones and is spread using malicious apps listed on the legitimate Google Play store. The banking malware initially surfaced on Russian hacking forums in 2016, where it was distributed as an open-source banking trojan with guidance on how to set up the client and components. In 2019, the malware introduced what seemed to be a nearly working <e2>ransomware</e2> component and spread using fraudulent apps on Google’s Play Store. [SEP]

Update as of July 23, 2015 1:00 AM PDT (UTC-7) We have added a link to a previous report discussing this threat. Timeline of posts related to the Hacking Team DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their <e1>Remote Control System (RCS)</e1> agent installed in their targets’ systems. [SEP]
[CLS] Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e2>“Android.BankBot.149.origin”</e2>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] The app is installed on the phone and it then contacts the server to download a loader, which then provides the additional capabilities <e1>Mandrake</e1> needs to take control of the device. "The malware operates in stages, with the first stage being a benign app with no malicious behaviour, other than the ability to download and install a second-stage payload when expressly directed to do so. It is safe to say that its operator won't trigger this malicious behaviour while running in Google's analysis environment," Botezatu explained. The malware tricks the user into providing it with additional privileges on the device. "What seems to be a simple process such as going through an End-User License Agreement and accepting it is actually translated behind the scenes into requesting and granting extremely powerful permissions. With those permissions, the malware gets complete control of the device and data on it," said Botezatu. SEE: This new Android mobile malware targets banks, financial services across Europe While it's still uncertain who is exactly targeted by Mandrake and why, the attackers are aware that if they push the boat out too far, their campaign will be more likely to be discovered. We don't know who runs the cyber-criminal operation behind Mandrake, but the malware will specifically avoid running on devices in former Soviet Union countries, Africa and the Middle East. Researchers note that some of the first countries made exempt from Mandrake attacks were <e2>Ukraine</e2>, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. [SEP]

[CLS] TrickBot uses a malicious Android app to bypass 2FA by various banks Malware authors released a new <e2>Android</e2> application that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to various online banking customers via SMS or push notification. This malicious app is developed to intercept one-time password, mobile TAN and pushTAN authentication codes. The Windows computers infected by TrickBot employed man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to ask victims for their online banking mobile phone numbers and device types in order to prompt them to install a fake security app — now called TrickMo. The Android app, called “TrickMo” by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German (in September 2019) users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware. The <e1>TrickMo</e1> app gets updated and is pushed via infected desktops of victims due to the web injects in online banking sessions. [SEP]
[CLS] First Twitter‑controlled Android botnet discovered Detected by ESET as <e1>Android/Twitoor</e1>, this malware is unique because of its resilience mechanism. Instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server, it receives instructions via tweets. Android/Twitoor is a backdoor capable of downloading other malware onto an infected device. It has been active for around one month. This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of Android/Twitoor.A, can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one. “Using Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” says Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. Malware that enslaves devices to form botnets needs to be able to receive updated instructions. That communication is an Achilles heel for any botnet – it may raise suspicion and, cutting the bots off is always lethal to the botnet’s functioning. Additionally, should the command-and-control (C&C) servers get seized by the authorities, it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet. To make the Twitoor botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it’s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,” explains <e2>Štefanko</e2>. In the Windows space, Twitter, founded in 2006, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers opine that the <e2>Trojan</e2> was actually launched in June 2019 and is yet under the active development phase. According to researchers, cybercriminals have released at least five different versions of Ginp in the past five months, which reflects how eagerly cybercriminals are vying to improvise this Trojan. ThreatFabric analysts claim that Ginp is unique because its codebase was developed from scratch and is being expanded continuously through updates. Its target list is also considerably narrow as its main targets are the banks in Spain. The code of <e1>Gino</e1> has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis. [SEP]

After downloading it, DualToy will copy the IPA file via the AFC service to the iOS device’s /var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging directory, and then install it via the installation_proxy service. The downloaded kuaiyong.ipa has an obfuscated bundle ID of “pWsbshWBn5XN9kk0twBUECAVt2E.dsE7UfuXZdinV60edM4u1Ul0d6hSf66akdZrmp”.

[CLS] maza-in names the malware Anubis and used the following logo in his advertisement of the malware: The list of bot features below shows how much maza-in improved upon the original shared BankBot code to create (the latest version of) Anubis: Overlaying: Static (hardcoded in bot) Overlaying: Dynamic (C2 based) Keylogging Contact list collection Screen streaming Sound recording SMS harvesting: SMS forwarding SMS blocking SMS sending Files/pictures collection Calls: USSD request making Ransomware: Cryptolocker Remote actions: Data-wiping Remote actions: Back-connect proxy Notifications: Push notifications C2 Resilience: <e2>Twitter</e2>/Telegram/Pastebin C2 update channels In addition to the new features and improvements made, Anubis also has a larger (default) target list. In the Appendix you can find a full list of apps targeted by Anubis (437 applications in total). Distribution As a rented Trojan, Anubis was distributed using a wide range of delivery techniques: Google Play campaigns: using self-made or rented droppers actors were able to bypass Google Play security mechanisms and spread the Trojan using the official app store, potentially infecting thousands of victims at a time. Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of <e1>Anubis 2</e1> was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. [SEP]
[CLS] Dubbed <e1>Spynote</e1> by the researcher, the trojan targets those users who install apps in APK format, the process of downloading apps in APK format on Android devices is known as “sideloading” which is only possible if the user has allowed “Unknown Sources” in their security settings. The SpyNote RAT was found being discussed on several underground hacking forums by the researchers which, after analyzing turned out to be a bigger threat than expected. Upon scanning, it was discovered that SpyNote doesn’t require root access in order to take full control of an infected device. Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that’s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won’t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card. The researchers also found SpyNote’s sample scanned on VirusTotal. The Unit 42 also noted that SpyNot OmniRat and DroidJack. <e2>OmniRat</e2> was detected in 2015 targeting MAC, Windows or Andriod operating system while DroidJack RAT was found also found in fake Pokémon Go apps on Android store.

[CLS] One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a <e2>Flash</e2> zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and <e1>Nuclear Exploit Pack</e1>. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. [SEP]
[CLS] A new <e2>Android</e2> Trojan called SpyNote has been identified by researchers who warn that attacks are forthcoming. The Trojan, found by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as <e1>OmniRat</e1> and DroidJack. [SEP]
[CLS] Trend Micro researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling RCSAndroid (<e1>Remote Control System Android</e1>), which they says, is one of the "most professionally developed and sophisticated" pieces of Android malware a.k.a Android hacking tool they have ever seen. RCSAndroid is a sophisticated, real-world surveillance and hacking tool that provides even unskilled hackers to deploy one of the world's more advanced surveillance suites for Google's mobile operating system Android.

Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871) vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing another local privilege escalation exploit to execute. When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a <e2>local privilege escalation vulnerability</e2> in Android devices. [SEP]
[CLS] The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named <e1>FrozenCell</e1> - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e2>Frozen Cell</e2> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

Timeline of posts related to the Hacking Team DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their <e2>Remote Control System (RCS)</e2> agent installed in their targets’ systems. [SEP]

[CLS] Over the past 12 months many technical issues occurred that led to ‘unhappy customers’. The <e1>Cerberus</e1> makers thus decided to end the rental service, & refund active license holders. On Aug. 10, the malware author shared the source code of the trojan to the general public. Simultaneous Campaigns Meanwhile, researchers said that in Feb. they started seeing simultaneous campaigns using both trojans, however, it seems that the new Alien malware was operated separately & was slightly different from Cerberus. The big difference between the 2 types is Alien’s 2FA-stealing technique, a feature that Cerberus lacked, they commented. A further feature of Alien is its RAT capability, which has been implemented separately from the main command handler, using different command-&-control (C2) endpoints. “Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus & Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own,” researchers suggested. Next Steps Researchers concluded that this link between Cerberus & Alien is a trend in the threat landscape to continue to be aware of. They predicted that more new malware families, based on Cerberus, will emerge in the final quarter of 2020. Regarding Alien specifically, & looking ahead, researchers explained that they expect the malware’s authors to continually improve its remote-access function. “They could also build an ATS [automatic transfer system] feature to automate the fraud process,” commented researchers. “What can be considered for granted is that the number of new banking trojans will only continue growing, many embedding new & improved features to increase the success rate of fraud.” Financial Institutions Researchers, therefore, urge all <e2>financial institutions</e2> to understand their current & future threat exposure, & consequently implement the relevant detection & control techniques.

[CLS] One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, <e1>Q-Cyber</e1>, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload.

[CLS] “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. <e2>Kaspersky</e2> spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the U.S. reported the second largest attacks (17.17%) and Hong Kong stood third (4.81%). Earlier, Kaspersky uncovered AppleJeus, a malicious operation by North Korea’s cyber-hacking outfit ‘Lazarus Group’ to intrude on cryptocurrency exchanges and applications.

[CLS] By “all” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020. The latest version is analyzed here; we weren’t able to determine if the earlier versions were also malicious. According to its profile at Google Play (see Figure 2) the app reached a mere 10+ downloads. We reported it to Google on May 16, 2020 and since May 19, 2020 the app has no longer been available on Google Play. The developer name used, GAS Brazil, suggests the criminals behind the app targeted Brazilian users. Apart from including the country’s name, the app’s name is probably intended to imply a relationship with the antifraud solution named GAS Tecnologia. That security software is commonly installed on computers in Brazil as several banks require it to log into their online banking. However, there is also an English version of the DEFENSOR ID app (see Figure 3) besides the Portuguese one, and that app has neither geographical nor language restrictions. Playing further off the suggested GAS Tecnologia link, the app promises better security for its users. The description in Portuguese promises more protection for the user’s applications, including end-to-end encryption. Deceptively, the app was listed in the Education section. Functionality After starting, DEFENSOR ID requests the following permissions: allow modify system settings permit drawing over other apps, and activate <e2>accessibility services</e2>. If an unsuspecting user grants these permissions (see Figure 4), the trojan can read any text displayed in any app the user may launch – and send it to the attackers. [SEP]

(Researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014.) The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations. Based on the leaked code, the RCSAndroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

[CLS] Pegasus For Android: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, Lookout and <e1>Google</e1> are releasing research into the Android version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: Pegasus. A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets. Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in <e2>Israel</e2>, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. [SEP]

[CLS] From our analysis of the <e1>TrickMo</e1> mobile malware, it is apparent that TrickMo is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in Germany. Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks. In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a “kill switch” that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device. Why Do Desktop Trojans Use a Mobile Component? About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim’s online banking account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client’s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous <e2>Zeus</e2> Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ZitMo” (Zeus in the Mobile). [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers report 70,000 attacks between August and October with targets primarily based in <e2>Russia</e2>. In a technical brief released last week, researchers at Kaspersky Lab shed new light on the Rotexy malware, which was first spotted in October 2014 as an SMS spyware trojan. “The modern version of Rotexy combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware,” wrote Kaspersky Lab researchers Tatyana Shishkova and Lev Pikman. The latest version of the malware goes well beyond eavesdropping on SMS messages and has incorporated advanced device screen manipulation with the intent of stealing bank card numbers, as well carrying out ransomware attacks, they said. The Kaspersky analysis details four years of steady improvements to Rotexy. The trojan’s staple and unique feature has always been the use of a combination of three command-and-control sources which include conventional C&C servers, SMS messaging and utilizing the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform (where it sends small messages in JavaScript Object Notation format to a mobile device using <e1>Google</e1> servers).

The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers. Researchers said that a company called eSurv S.R.L. was also involved. <e1>eSurv</e1> was once a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S. [SEP]

The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo. Chunghwa Post - The government-owned corporation Chunghwa is the official postal service of Taiwan. Swiss Post - The national postal service of <e2>Switzerland</e2>, a fully state-owned limited company (AG) regulated by public law. [SEP]
[CLS] Report: NSO Group's Pegasus Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the <e2>Financial Times</e2> on Friday. According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the <e1>Times</e1> wrote. [SEP]

[CLS] ” Newer features coming to <e1>Anubis</e1> banking trojan The Anubis banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue <e2>app stores</e2> and malicious URLs. [SEP]

[CLS] FakeSpy Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> threat group infect Android users with the FakeSpy infostealer. Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the <e2>United Kingdom</e2> and the United States.

[CLS] Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as <e1>Frozen Cell</e1>, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party. Palestine is a lightning rod of political controversy both around the world and domestically, as the territories of the <e2>West Bank</e2> and Gaza Strip have played host to an ongoing and deadly clash between Hamas and Fatah.

[CLS] Following screenshot shows this functionality in action: Other functions In addition to the functionalities we’ve described, the <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware. SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C. The screenshot below shows SpyNote RAT scanning for Wi-Fi and enabling it if a known channel is found: Additional features - SpyNote RAT could click photos using the device's camera, based on commands from C&C. - There were two interesting sub-classes found inside Main Activity: Receiver and Sender. Receiver was involved in receiving commands from the Server and the main functionality of Sender was to send all the data collected to the C&C over Wi-Fi. - SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device’s location to identify the exact location of the victim. SpyNote RAT builder The SpyNote Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness. What we found were several other fake apps developed using the SpyNote builder, which should come as a warning to Android users. Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV <e2>Hotstar</e2> Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come.

[CLS] Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “<e2>Android</e2> BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e1>“Android.BankBot.149.origin”</e1>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. [SEP]
[CLS] The malicious Dardesh <e2>chat app</e2> was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. “The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,” the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed APT-C-23 to be behind this scheme. “Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers,” they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the <e1>FrozenCell</e1> family attributed to APT-C-23. [SEP]

Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year.

[CLS] But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called <e1>adb.exe,</e1> which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e2>ZergHelper</e2>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]

As noted in September 2019, Volexity suspected that the Evil Eye attackers had also targeted iPhones based on the attackers' C2 servers going offline shortly after Project Zero's findings were made public. These more recent findings confirm the suspicion that the attackers were indeed likely the same. It can now be confirmed that in the past six months, Uyghur sites have led to malware for all major platforms, representing a considerable development and upkeep effort by the attackers to spy on the Uyghur population.

[CLS] "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," <e2>IBM</e2> researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious <e1>Ryuk</e1> ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials.

[CLS] For instance, the first time the malware attempted to access location data, an infected phone would have displayed the following dialogue, asking for permission: Lookout researchers reported their findings to <e1>Apple</e1>, and the company revoked the enterprise certificate. The revocation has the effect of preventing the apps from being installed on new iPhones and stopping them from running on infected devices. Researchers who discovered Exodus reported their findings to <e2>Google</e2>, and the company removed the nearly 25 apps from Google Play. [SEP]
[CLS] “This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of <e1>Rotexy</e1> and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives,” researchers said. Originally, the trojan was identified as Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but as it grew more sophisticated researchers assigned it to another family – Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy. Rotexy’s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of antivirus or banking applications). The most current version can block the devices’ screen to perform either ransomware or phishing functions. The New Attack Process The most current version of the trojan spreads via links sent in phishing SMSs that prompt the user to install an app. As it launches, the app requests device administrator rights, and then starts communicating with its C&C server. When first launching, the trojan checks to make sure the victim’s device is located in Russia and that it isn’t an emulator used by security researchers to spot malware. If the device checks out, the trojan registers with the mobile notification service Google Cloud Messaging and launches a service to check if the trojan has device administrator privileges, according researchers. “If the <e2>Trojan</e2> detects an attempt to revoke its administrator privileges, it starts periodically switching off the phone screen, trying to stop the user actions,” researchers said. [SEP]
[CLS] To make the <e1>Twitoor</e1> botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of <e2>social networks</e2>. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely.

[CLS] ” If they click on the subsequent dialog boxes, <e1>TangleBot</e1> malware installs. In propagation and theme, TangleBot resembles other mobile malware, such as the FluBot SMS malware that targets the U.K. and Europe or the CovidLock Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients. But its wide-ranging access to mobile device functions is what sets it apart, Cloudmark researchers said. “The malware has been given the moniker TangleBot because of its many levels of obfuscation and control over a myriad of entangled device functions, including contacts, SMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet access, [GPS], and camera and microphone,” they noted in a Thursday writeup. To reach such a long arm into Android’s internal business, TangleBot grants itself privileges to access and control all of the above, researchers said, meaning that the cyberattackers would now have carte blanche to mount attacks with a staggering array of goals. For instance, attackers can manipulate the incoming voice call function to block calls and can also silently make calls in the background, with users none the wiser. That’s a perfect setup for premium number fraud, where the user is charged a high rate for making a call to an attacker-controlled toll number. TangleBot can also send, obtain and process text messages for SMS fraud, two-factor authentication interception, self-propagation to contacts and more. It also has deep spyware capabilities, with the ability to record or directly stream camera, screen or microphone audio directly to the attacker, along with “other device observation capabilities,” according to Cloudmark. Gaining access to the GPS functionality, for example, creates the potential for stalkery location-tracking. And last but not least, the firm noted that the malware can take stock of installed applications and interact with them, as well as place overlay screens on top of these to, say, harvest credentials in the style of a <e2>banking trojan</e2>. “The ability to detect installed apps, app interactions and inject overlay screens is extremely problematic,” researchers noted. [SEP]
[CLS] Machine translation of this tweet reads: “Watch out for online banking: <e1>Emotet</e1> reloads TrickBot. On infected PCs, TrickBot displays a query for the mobile phone number and the device type used for banking and then prompts users to install an alleged security app.” When banking Trojans ask for this type of information, it usually means the next step will be an attempt to infect the victim’s mobile device. Our team went ahead and hunted for samples of the app and analyzed it in our labs. In this analysis, we get into the capabilities of the new variant and what we found to be a “kill switch” that can eliminate the malware remotely from an infected device. Desktop Trojans and Their Mobile Component The process by which Trojans attempt to infect mobile devices is at least a decade old. Usually, when users are already infected with malware like TrickBot on their desktop, they will see a web injection asking for their mobile device operating system (OS) type and phone number. Next, if they indicate that they use an Android-based device, the Trojan, impersonating their bank with web injections, fools the victim into installing a fake security app. The supposed purpose of that app is to obtain and use a required “security code” to log in to their online banking site. Our research team analyzed the malicious Android application that is most likely being spread by TrickBot and dubbed it “TrickMo.” Targeting users in Germany at this time, TrickMo is the latest variation in the transaction authentication number (TAN)-stealing malware category. Its main capabilities include: Stealing personal device information Intercepting SMS messages Recording targeted applications for one-time password (TAN) Lockdown of the phone Stealing pictures from the device Self-destruction and removal As banks release more advanced security measures, <e2>banking malware</e2> evolves to keep up with the perpetual arms race.

[CLS] For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. <e1>Rotexy</e1> then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “/[number]” (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. In this version of Rotexy, dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used. 2016 From <e2>mid-2016</e2> on, the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains. [SEP]

[CLS] The code of <e1>Gino</e1> has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis. Researchers further claim that there are striking similarities between the codes of both Trojans but it cannot be said that Ginp is the replica of Anubis rather it is inspired by Anubis. Such as, Ginp has traces of some of the codes of Anubis and the names of components of both the Trojans are also the same. The malware works by accessing the target device in the disguise of an authentic app. As soon as the malware gains access to the device, it hides the app icon and asks for Accessibility Service permissions. When the user grants permission, it automatically gets dynamic permissions. Using these permissions, the malware can send messages, make calls and perform overlay attacks easily without alerting the user. In June 2019, the Ginp malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven’t ever seen before in any malware campaign. A total of 24 apps are targeted and infected with Ginp, all of which belong to 7 Spanish banks including Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, Caixa Bank, <e2>EVO Banco</e2>, Santander, and Kutxabank. [SEP]

FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more. FakeSpy first targeted South Korean and Japanese speakers. However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, <e2>Germany</e2>, United Kingdom, United States, and others. [SEP]

[CLS] One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told <e2>The Post</e2> that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. [SEP]

[CLS] When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the Twitter platform, something <e1>FakeSpy</e1> has done in its past attacks. Analysis of the malicious iOS profile also revealed further connections, as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that FakeSpy deployed early this year. Conclusion and security recommendations The continued monitoring of XLoader showed how its operators continuously changed its features, such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques. This newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won’t be stopping soon. Being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies, as well as prepare for upcoming attacks. In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we’ve also seen in a different malware family like FakeSpy also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

[CLS] Report: NSO Group's <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday. According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from <e2>NSO</e2>’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”.

[CLS] 0 (Detected by <e2>Trend Micro</e2> as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both Android and Flash Player. Once a user downloads one of these malicious apps into their devices and opens it, a popup overlay will appear prompting the user to enter their login credentials. The credentials are then sent to a Command and Control (C&C server) that the attackers control. Red Alert 2.0 will block incoming calls from banks, presumably to block verification attempts. The malware also intercepts SMS text messages, sending messages to the attackers for future use. By disrupting the device’s actual communication capabilities, the attackers can maximize the time spent doing malicious activities. According to its researchers, Red Alert 2.0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500—a low price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers. Red Alert 2.0 can target mobile devices that are running Android versions of up to 6.0, which was released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores. No versions of the malicious apps carrying the malware have been detected on the official <e1>Google</e1> Play Store as of the time of publication. [SEP]

[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to spy on individuals in the <e2>Caucasus</e2> regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria. Recent samples of Monokle include the Xposed framework that allows Android users to apply modules to an Android device’s ROM(Read Only Memory). Some Monokle fake apps include Xposed modules that implement functionality for hooking and hiding presence in the process list Much of the core malicious functionality implemented in the later samples of Monokle use an XOR obfuscated DEX file in the assets folder. “The functionality hidden in this DEX file includes all cryptographic functions implemented in the open source library spongycastle11, various e-mail protocols, extraction and exfiltration of all data, serialisation and deserialisation of data using the Thrift protocol, and rooting and hooking functionality, among others ” continues the report. As anticipated, Monokle was developed by STC, the experts noticed that Monokle and the STC’s Android security suite called Defender are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure. “Command and control infrastructure that communicates with the Defender application also communicates with Monokle samples. The signing certificates used for signing Android application packages overlap between Defender and Monokle as well.” continues the report. “Additional overlap was observed by <e1>Lookout</e1> researchers between Monokle and the defensive security software produced by STC in the authors’ development and implementation choices. [SEP]
[CLS] “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the <e2>Ahrar al-Sham</e2> militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.” In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to Special Technology Center (STC), a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U.S. government under President Obama, for interfering in the 2016 presidential elections. Lookout researchers said that the group has a software suite with both defensive and offensive capabilities that it offers to government customers. “STC’s Android security suite and Monokle are tied to one another with the help of signer certificates and overlapping command-and-control infrastructure,” according to the report. “Command-and-control infrastructure that communicates with the Defender application [a known <e1>STC</e1> product] also communicates with Monokle samples.

[CLS] Later in 2016, a new variant appeared,” wrote senior malware researcher <e2>Claud Xiao</e2> in a technical description of the Trojan. Researchers said once DualToy infects a Windows machine, it looks for the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes, and downloads drivers for both if they’re missing in order to infect mobile devices once connected. “Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms,” Xiao wrote. Researchers say they have observed 8,000 unique samples of the DualToy variant to date, and add they can’t be sure how many mobile devices have been infected by the malware. Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… <e1>WireLurker</e1> installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones.

[CLS] The source code of <e1>Cerberus</e1> was released in September 2020 on underground hacking forums after its operators failed an auction. According to the experts, ERMAC is operated by threat actors behind the BlackRock mobile malware. On August 17, two forum members named “ermac” and “DukeEugene” started advertising the malware. “DukeEugene”, posted the following message in his account: “Android botnet ERMAC. I will rent a new android botnet with wide functionality to a narrow circle of people (10 people). 3k$ per month. Details in PM.” DukeEugene is threat actor known to be behind the BlackRock banking Trojan. ERMAC differs from Cerberus in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm. “Despite the usage of different obfuscation techniques and new method of string encryption – using Blowfish encryption algorithm, we can definitely state that ERMAC is another Cerberus-based trojan.” reads the analysis published by Threatfabric. “Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts. clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device At the time of writing, ThreatFabric researchers with the help of support <e2>@malwrhunterteam</e2> experts determine that ERMAC is only targeting Poland, where is being distributed under the guise of delivery service and government applications.

[CLS] Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, <e1>IBM</e1>’s Trusteer team found evidence that Ginp malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of Turkish banks, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in Poland and the United Kingdom. Specifically, our team discovered new Ginp overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing on the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2). These overlay pages are spoofs of legitimate banking pages, meant to deceive mobile device users into sharing confidential banking and other information. Several of these fake overlays mimic <e2>banks</e2> in Turkey, suggesting that malware operators intend to use these pages in future campaigns to target customers of Turkish banks. [SEP]
[CLS] Through this blog post <e2>ThreatFabric</e2> experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used <e1>Bankbot</e1> for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. [SEP]
[CLS] With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic <e2>France</e2> Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.K. U.S. While there were 10 downloader apps in the Google Play Store at the time of this writing, the campaign is rather hefty. X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster’s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. IBM X-Force reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. Malicious apps are a blight that both store operators and developers work hard to limit. Still, it is a recurring problem: In 2017, X-Force mobile researchers reported numerous occasions on which financial malware had sneaked into the Google Play Store, with the <e1>BankBot</e1> Android malware family leading the pack.

[CLS] Malware analysts at <e1>Kaspersky Lab</e1> took a closer look at this mobile threat that was noticed for the first time in 2014 and proved to be highly versatile since its early releases. Multiple communication channels One of the features that make it stand out of the crowd is the use at the same time of three separate communication channels for receiving commands. The researchers found that it can get instructions via the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service that delivers messages in JSON format to mobile devices. This channel, however, won't work beyond April 11, 2019, because Google has deprecated it. Another method Rotexy uses to deliver commands to the compromised target is from a command and control (C2) server, as it is typical for most malware. The third method is SMS based and allows the operator to control the actions of malware by sending a text message to the infected mobile phone. The latest version of Rotexy targeted mostly users located in Russia, although Kaspersky noticed victims in Ukraine, Germany, <e2>Turkey</e2>, and several other countries as well. [SEP]
[CLS] Newer banking trojan apps Of course, <e1>Anubis</e1> is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. Once downloaded, EventBot amasses a carte blanche of permissions, including starting at bootup and maintaining a persistent background process allowing the app to monitor the smartphone continuously. The trojan also prevents the phone from sleeping and ignores battery optimization settings. EventBot also obtains control of Android’s accessibility services to run a keylogger, receive notifications as well as retrieve the content of open windows. Although still in the development stage, the app may be a more significant threat to <e2>mobile banking</e2> compared to Anubis. [SEP]
[CLS] Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, <e2>Australia</e2>, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using <e1>Twitter</e1> and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. [SEP]
[CLS] The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and <e2>heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871)</e2> vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing another local privilege escalation exploit to execute. When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices. Hacking Team has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and CVE-2013-6282 in their attacks. The said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor. The shell backdoor then installs the RCSAndroid agent. This agent has two core modules, the Evidence Collector and the Event Action Trigger. The Evidence Collector module is responsible for the spying routines outlined above. One of its most notable routines is capturing voice calls in real time by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service. The basic idea is to hook the voice call process in mediaserver. Take voice call playback process for example. The mediaserver will first builds a new unique track, start to play the track, loop play all audio buffer, then finally stop the playback. The raw wave audio buffer frame can be dumped in the getNextBuffer() function. With the help of the open-source <e1>Android Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Toolkit</e1> and root privilege, it is possible to intercept any function execution. [SEP]
[CLS] Previously, it's been assumed <e1>APT-C-23</e1> is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich. Rather, it was downloaded later when the user was interacting with the app. With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. Andrew Blaich, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while ViperRAT apps had about a thousand combined installs. What those may seem like a low numbers, Blaich said Desert Scorpion "is a part of a targeted attack and not used for broad global-wide surveillance," and that "this number is in line with what we would expect." After Lookout reached out, Google removed the apps from the app store. "When we were notified by Lookout, we removed the apps from <e2>Play</e2> and updated Play Protect to help ensure users are secured," said a Google spokesperson. [SEP]
[CLS] The Trojan, found by <e2>Palo Alto Networks</e2>’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as <e1>OmniRat</e1> and DroidJack. [SEP]

This kind of encryption is good for protecting your privacy, but governments don’t like it because it makes it difficult for them to spy on people, whether tracking criminals and terrorists or, as some governments have been known to do, snooping on dissidents, protesters and journalists.

[CLS] ” Newer features coming to <e1>Anubis</e1> banking trojan The Anubis banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at <e2>Cybereason Nocturnus</e2> recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. [SEP]

[CLS] FireEye’s experts observed new samples of <e1>RuMMs</e1> on 3rd April 2016 but the earliest such sample was identified way back on 18th January 2016. Between this period the company has observed around 300 different samples of the same family. It has been observed by security experts that the malware’s operational capabilities are controlled from the remote C2 server. We can, therefore, assume that the C2 server can customize the contents of the SMS messages that are to be distributed to expand the scope of this malicious Smishing campaign. The servers also determine the recipients of these outgoing messages and also the timespan during which the voice calls will be forwarded. FireEye’s investigators emulated an already infected Android device to communicate with the C2 server of the RuMMS malware and they identified that the C2 server instructed their device to send out four different SMS messages to four unique numbers. The phone numbers were of Russia-based financial institutions. Three out of the four messages were aimed at checking out the account balance of the user at that particular institution. The fourth message’s destination still remains unconfirmed. When the team probed further, they detected a number of forum posts in which various victims complained about transferring of up to 600 rubles from their accounts after their phones were infected with RuMMS malware. It cannot be confirmed as of now how many people have been affected by this malware but FireEye experts believe that “there have been at least 2,729 infections between January 2016 and early April 2016, with a peak in <e2>March</e2> of more than 1,100 infections.

Inside One Victim’s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, France, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers <e1>Aruba</e1>, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]

[CLS] The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, <e2>France</e2>, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the Android recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing.” One example of a message used in the latest FakeSpy campaign is an alert from the postal service local to the region of the victim, informing them that the service tried to send a package, but the receiver was not at home, for instance. Then, “the link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK),” according to a report on the campaign, by Ofir Almkias, mobile analyst with <e1>Cybereason</e1>.

[CLS] TrickBot Mobile App Bypasses 2‐Factor Authentication for Net Banking Services The malware authors behind TrickBot <e2>banking Trojan</e2> have developed a new Android app that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to Internet banking customers via SMS or relatively more secure push notifications, and complete fraudulent transactions. The Android app, called "TrickMo" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware. "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," IBM researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious <e1>Ryuk</e1> ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials.

[CLS] A new Android malware has appeared in the threat landscape, tracked as MobiHok RAT, it borrows the code from the old <e1>SpyNote</e1> RAT. Experts from threat intelligence firm SenseCy spotted a new piece of Android RAT, dubbed MobiHok RAT, that used code from the old SpyNote RAT. At the beginning of July 2019, the experts spotted a threat actor dubbed mobeebom that was offering for sale an Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT) dubbed MobiHok v4 on a prominent English hacking forum. The experts discovered that mobeebom is active on multiple Arab-speaking hacking forums under different pseudonyms, a circumstance that suggests that he is an Arab-speaker. Researchers also noticed that the posts published by the hacker were using poor English. mobeebom has been promoting the MobiHok RAT through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since January 2019. MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In July 2016, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like <e2>OmniRat</e2> and DroidJack, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum.

[CLS] Anubis II - malware and afterlife Introduction Besides being the Egyptian God associated with mummification and afterlife, <e1>Anubis</e1> is also an Android banking malware that has caused quite some trouble for over 300 financial institutions worldwide since 2017. Anubis II is the Android banking Trojan created and advertised by an actor with the nickname “maza-in”. This malware family goes beyond the well-known overlay attacks by combining advanced features such as screen streaming, remote file browsing, sound recording, keylogging and even a network proxy, making it an efficient banking malware but also a potential spying tool. Effectively, Anubis can be considered one of the most used Android banking Trojans since late 2017. As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as online banking credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post <e2>ThreatFabric</e2> experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. [SEP]

[CLS] In addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, DualToy also performs the following activities on Android and iOS devices: Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like <e2>AceDeceiver</e2>) Several years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to pair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy. However, DualToy assumes any physically connected mobile devices will belong to the same owner as the infected PC to which they are connected, which means the pairing is likely already authorized. DualToy tries to reuse existing pairing records to directly interact with mobile devices in the background. Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms. Infecting Android Devices Almost all samples of DualToy are capable of infecting Android devices connected with the compromised Windows PC via USB cable. This functionality is usually implemented in a module named NewPhone.dll, DevApi.dll or app.dll. DualToy assumes ADB is enabled on the connected Android device. If ADB isn't enabled (which is the default option), the . However, some users, especially those who want to install Android apps from a PC or Mac, or who want to do advanced operations with their Android devices, This is because ADB is both the only official interface for a Windows or Mac computer to operate an Android device via USB and it is a debugging interface. Install ADB drivers Once loaded, the module will first download universal Windows ADB drivers from its C2 server (e.g., from http[:]//www.zaccl.com/tool/new_tool.zip) and install them. Then, some variants will directly drop a file named adb.exe which is the standard ADB Windows client. Other variants have compiled the ADB client’s source code into the module so that they could also perform ADB operations. Instead of <e1>adb.exe,</e1> the newest variant will drop tadb. [SEP]

[CLS] Researchers at Checkpoint spotted the malware and say it was hosted on apps created by Korean developers Kiniwini, registered as <e1>ENISTUDIO Corp</e1>. These included Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, Judy’s Happy House, and Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess. The Israeli firm says the Judy malware is "an auto-clicking adware" that makes money for its creators by falsifying clicks on online adverts. It adds that the malware is "definitely an illegitimate use of the users' mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks". Since the existence of Judy has been publicly disclosed, Google has removed all affected apps from the Play Store. During this sweep, Judy was found on 41 apps from Kiniwinia and nine apps from other creators in total. "The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, and it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly," the security company said. Many of the affected Judy apps have been on the Google Play Store for several years and have all been recently updated, Checkpoint said. As such, it isn't possible to accurately say how many people may have been impacted by the malware. Based on the number of times the apps have been downloaded (using high and low estimates), though, Checkpoint believes it "may have reached between 8.5 and 36.5 million users". How to protect yourself against Judy and other app malware An Android tablet or phone will only have been infected by Judy if one of the apps was downloaded. Checkpoint has published the names of all the affected apps as part of its blog post, found in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. If you have any of the apps on your phone, they should be deleted immediately – if they haven't already been automatically removed. Malware isn't new on the Google Play Store, but the company has done a lot in recent years to curb it being inserted in the apps the store hosts. In 2012, Google introduced project 'Bouncer' that automatically scans products uploaded and blocks software that may be malicious. Despite this, malware does slip through the cracks. In addition, <e2>Google Play Protect</e2> automatically checks apps before they are downloaded and will remove harmful apps from devices. [SEP]
[CLS] Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. <e1>Marcher</e1> In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot <e2>Gustuff</e2> DiseaseBot Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

[CLS] About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim’s <e2>online banking</e2> account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client’s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous <e1>Zeus</e1> Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ZitMo” (Zeus in the Mobile). [SEP]
[CLS] This screen-recording feature abuses <e2>accessibility services</e2> in Android. Accessibility services were originally developed by Google to help users with disabilities. Once downloaded, <e1>TrickMo</e1> uses the accessibility settings to carry out various malicious operations, including preventing users from uninstalling the app, becoming the default SMS app (by changing device settings), monitoring any running apps and scraping on-screen text. [SEP]
[CLS] Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, <e2>social media</e2> apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to <e1>APT-C-27</e1>. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

[CLS] <e2>Lookout</e2> Discovers Phishing Sites Distributing New IOS And Android Surveillanceware Background: Android surveillanceware Early last year, Lookout discovered a sophisticated Android surveillanceware agent that appears to have been created for the lawful intercept market. The agent appears to have been under development for at least five years and consists of three stages. First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. Security Without Borders has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features. Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named Connexxa S.R.L. and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the <e1>eSurv software</e1> and brand was sold from Connexxa S. [SEP]

The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. <e1>Connexxa</e1> is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. [SEP]

[CLS] TJ Short, VP Security Operations at <e2>Cerberus Sentinel</e2>, says the trojan employs ingenious methods to trick users. “The coolest feature, though, is that once you connect to your bank, complete your MFA and finish your bank business, it will activate. So when you are finished with the transaction, it will keep the tunnel open that has already passed the MFA requirements pop up a fake ‘transaction has ended jpeg’ for you to see. At that point, it will contact the C2 server and act as a proxy gateway allowing the attacker to access your financial information.” Newer features coming to Anubis banking trojan The Anubis banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.

[CLS] The malware, <e1>Android/SpyC32.A</e1>, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in 2017 by several security research teams.

[CLS] A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a <e2>local privilege escalation vulnerability</e2> in Android devices. Hacking Team has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and CVE-2013-6282 in their attacks. The said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor. The shell backdoor then installs the RCSAndroid agent. This agent has two core modules, the Evidence Collector and the Event Action Trigger. The Evidence Collector module is responsible for the spying routines outlined above. One of its most notable routines is capturing voice calls in real time by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service. The basic idea is to hook the voice call process in mediaserver. Take voice call playback process for example. The mediaserver will first builds a new unique track, start to play the track, loop play all audio buffer, then finally stop the playback. The raw wave audio buffer frame can be dumped in the getNextBuffer() function. With the help of the open-source <e1>Android Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Toolkit</e1> and root privilege, it is possible to intercept any function execution. [SEP]

[CLS] Researchers say they have observed 8,000 unique samples of the <e2>DualToy</e2> variant to date, and add they can’t be sure how many mobile devices have been infected by the malware. Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]

[CLS] Hamas-linked spyware targeting Palestinians removed from Google Play store A hacking group which analysts believe is linked to <e1>Hamas</e1> successfully placed highly targeted surveillanceware in the Google Play Store in order to spy on Palestinian targets, according to new research from the mobile security firm Lookout. The newly identified malware, known as Desert Scorpion, was deployed against over 100 individuals of interest in Palestine. A similar 2017 campaign from the same “highly active” group, dubbed APT-C-23. The group has been linked to Hamas’s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students. Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said <e2>Andrew Blaich</e2>, Lookout’s head of device intelligence.

[CLS] Variant “Based on our in-depth knowledge of the trojan, we can prove that the Alien malware is a fork of the initial variant of <e1>Cerberus</e1> (v1), active since early Jan. 2020 & rented out at the same time as Cerberus,” observed researchers with Threat Fabric, in a Thursday analysis. “Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS [malware as a service] for fraudsters.” Alien Malware The Alien RAT has various commonly used Android malware capabilities, including the ability to launch overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages & harvest contact lists – as well as keylogging, location-collecting & other capabilities. However, it also deploys several more advanced techniques, including a notification sniffer that allows it to access all new updates on infected devices. This includes 2FA codes, which allow the malware to bypass 2FA security measures. Android.Permission Alien uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself. It does this using an advanced remote access feature that compromises the TeamViewer application, giving the bad player behind the malware remote control over the victim’s devices. TeamViewer is a proprietary software application used for remote control, desktop & online meetings. Remote Control “When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access & change device settings, install & remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers & <e2>social networks</e2>),” outlined researchers.

[CLS] In-depth analysis of a <e1>Cerberus</e1> trojan variant Android banking trojans are nothing new, and Cerberus is just the latest in a long line of such malware to hit the headlines. Even the fact that Cerberus is being “rented out” on underground forums is not unique. Malware “for hire” has become a theme. This trojan uses peoples’ worry of COVID-19 to steal financial data such as credit card numbers. It also uses overlay attacks to trick victims into providing personal information and can capture two-factor authentication details. “Corona-Apps.apk” is a variant of the Cerberus banking trojan. They are usually spread via phishing campaigns. Corona-Apps.apk uses its connection with the actual virus name to trick users into installing it on their smartphones.

[CLS] <e2>Anubis</e2> Strikes Again: Mobile Malware Continues to Plague Users in Official App Stores IBM X-Force mobile malware researchers have observed several developers actively uploading Android malware downloaders to the Google Play Store. Following ongoing campaigns against Google Play, our research team has been monitoring banking malware activity in official app stores. The team recently reported that downloader apps in the store are being used as the first step in an infection routine that fetches the Marcher (aka <e1>Marcher ExoBot</e1>) and BankBot Anubis mobile banking Trojans. [SEP]
[CLS] According to an official report, Kaspersky Lab’s <e1>Global Research and Analysis Team</e1> (GReAT) discovered the unusual activity of attackers who penetrated the network of an <e2>Asia</e2>-based cryptocurrency exchange using Trojanized trading software to steal cryptocurrencies. [SEP]
[CLS] Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while <e1>Microsoft</e1> said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the Mexican government has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes. Its founder and CEO, Shalev Hulio, has justified targeting lawyers and journalists. The company is facing multiple lawsuits in Israel and Cyprus over alleged abuse of its spy tools. As the Next Web noted, cloud adoption worldwide is accelerating at a rapid pace, making vulnerabilities such as the one identified in the Times report critical ones. Cybersecurity firm <e2>Check Point</e2> recently identified unauthorized cloud and account access as among the biggest exploits for cloud services, while password-free two-step authentication could be one way of protecting customers from such attacks, the Next Web noted.

[CLS] If so, then the loader downloads the third stage, the core <e1>Mandrake</e1> malware. "Considering the complexity of the spying platform, we assume that every attack is targeted individually, executed with surgical precision and manual rather than automated," Bitdefender wrote. Mandrake's "ritual suicide" Mandrake tricks you by putting fake overlays on your screen, such as an end-user license agreement that must be agreed to. Those are tailored to different phones, screen sizes, languages and versions of Android. But when you click "OK" to accept the agreement, you're really granting it administrative privileges. Then Mandrake forwards all your text messages to the attackers, forwards phone calls to other numbers, blocks calls, installs or remove apps, steals contact lists, hides notifications, records screen activity, steals passwords to your Facebook and online bank accounts, creates phishing pages to leech your credentials for <e2>Gmail</e2> and Amazon, and tracks your location.

[CLS] <e1>Ginp</e1> Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_Ginp.HRXB) to steal user login credentials and credit card details. ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after <e2>banking app</e2> users. [SEP]
[CLS] With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. <e2>Andrew Blaich</e2>, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while <e1>ViperRAT</e1> apps had about a thousand combined installs.

[CLS] By removing all the key instances (**pE2**) from the string, we produced the same string from the <e2>January</e2> sample: With 10 downloaders at this point, the campaign appears to be scaling up. Over time, we’ve seen the code evolve. As time went by between downloader versions, the developers added a simple obfuscation and expanded the downloader capabilities. The code was also altered slightly to avoid detection by Google Play’s security controls. According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. Anubis Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> from one of its C&C servers. [SEP]

[CLS] This malware sold to governments could help them spy on iPhones, researchers say Many people assume their iPhones are secure, but new research sent <e1>Apple</e1> scrambling to fix vulnerabilities that left users at risk. Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaws in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. [SEP]
[CLS] A Wide Range of Features Once installed, <e1>TrickMo</e1> is also capable of gaining persistence by starting itself after the device becomes interactive or after a new SMS message is received. In addition, it features an elaborate settings mechanism that lets a remote attacker issue commands to turn on/off specific features (e.g., accessibility permissions, recording status, SMS app status) via a command-and-control (C2) server or an SMS message. When the malware is run, it exfiltrates a wide range of information, including — Personal device information SMS messages Recording targeted applications for a one-time password (TAN) Photos But to avoid raising suspicion when stealing the TAN codes, TrickMo activates the lock screen, thereby preventing users from accessing their devices. Specifically, it uses a fake Android update screen to mask its OTP-stealing operations. And lastly, it comes with self-destruction and removal functions, which allows the cybercrime gang behind TrickMo to remove all traces of the malware's presence from a device after a successful operation. The kill switch can also be activated by SMS, but IBM researchers found that it was possible to decrypt the encrypted SMS commands using a hard-coded RSA private key embedded in the source code, thus making it possible to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that can turn the self-destruct feature on. Although this means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message, it's fair to assume that a future version of the app could rectify the use of hard-coded key strings for decryption. "The TrickBot trojan was one of the most active banking malware strains in the cybercrime arena in <e2>2019</e2>," IBM researchers concluded. [SEP]

[CLS] , and Italy using cloud providers <e1>Aruba</e1>, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.” The firm believes with “medium confidence” that Sneaky Kestrel acts on behalf of the <e2>UAE</e2>. It normally targets individuals inside the UAE, and one target hacked by the group previously received Pegasus links via SMS that “point to the same domain name used in the attacks on UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.

[CLS] As researchers from SfyLabs detail, <e1>RedAlert 2.0</e1> targets over 60 Android banking and social apps. When a potential victim opens one the targeted apps on their Android device, the malware overlays an appropriate dialog, enticing users to re-enter their login details. In this way, login credentials are stolen and passed to a remote server under the control of the hackers. Red Alert 2.0, which has been offered for sale on Russian-speaking hacking forums, is also capable of waltzing past two-factor authentication systems by intercepting SMS text messages that the smartphone receives and passing them onto hackers. Furthermore, according to researchers, Red Alert 2.0 continues to be updated with functionality recently added to block incoming calls from banks, including those which may be from financial fraud departments investigating potential malicious activity. In short, your Android phone gets infected by Red Alert 2.0 banking malware, hackers start to plunder your account to make unauthorised purchases or money transfers, and your bank can’t get hold of you if they suspect something suspicious is occurring. Red Alert 2.0 is said to work on phones running <e2>Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow)</e2> and earlier. [SEP]

[CLS] maza-in names the malware Anubis and used the following logo in his advertisement of the malware: The list of bot features below shows how much maza-in improved upon the original shared BankBot code to create (the latest version of) Anubis: Overlaying: Static (hardcoded in bot) Overlaying: Dynamic (C2 based) Keylogging Contact list collection Screen streaming Sound recording SMS harvesting: SMS forwarding SMS blocking SMS sending Files/pictures collection Calls: USSD request making Ransomware: Cryptolocker Remote actions: Data-wiping Remote actions: Back-connect proxy Notifications: Push notifications C2 Resilience: Twitter/Telegram/Pastebin C2 update channels In addition to the new features and improvements made, <e1>Anubis</e1> also has a larger (default) target list. In the Appendix you can find a full list of apps targeted by Anubis (437 applications in total). Distribution As a rented Trojan, Anubis was distributed using a wide range of delivery techniques: Google Play campaigns: using self-made or rented droppers actors were able to bypass Google Play security mechanisms and spread the Trojan using the official app store, potentially infecting thousands of victims at a time. Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of Anubis 2 was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. During Q1 2019, actor maza-in vanished from the threat landscape, leaving existing customers without support and updates. Although exact details about the vanishing of the actor remain unclear at the time of writing, a chain of events confirms that some abnormal activity took place around Anubis and its author. On December 13 2018 maza-in announces the release of Anubis 2.5; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code. On <e2>January 16 2019</e2> Anubis code is leaked in an underground forum (both backend code and unobfuscated APK). [SEP]
[CLS] Like other RATs, this version of <e1>SpyNote</e1> can also steal SMS messages and contacts from infected devices and funnel them back to the C2. The malware steals the contacts and writes them as a local array before they’re exfiltrated, Desai said. It also, for good measure, collects the device’s location and sends that along to attackers. While the RAT is sophisticated, there’s one catch, the firm claims. In order for the RAT to work, the infected device has to be connected to WiFi. That way it can transmit data and files to its C+C unfettered. It’s likely not the last we’ll hear about SpyNote in 2017, the firm claims, adding that researchers there uncovered a handful of copycat apps built with the same SpyNote malware builder. Apps designed to mimic Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Super Mario Run, and Pokemon Go are all making the rounds in the hacking community. So far this month they’ve already witnessed 120 different variants built with the tool. Like the phony Netflix app, Desai told Threatpost while these apps aren’t in the wild quite yet, he knows the payloads are in development. It’s unclear when attackers will begin to circulate these apps in earnest but the researchers are urging Android users to remain vigilant and only use apps downloaded through official app stores. One way these illegitimate apps are spread is through third-party app stores. This past summer, in the early days of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, gamers eager to play the game were surprised with backdoored versions of the game. In its infancy the app was only available in the United States, meaning some users had to sideload APKs, often malicious, in order to play. Researchers with <e2>Proofpoint</e2> observed one version rigged with a RAT dubbed DroidJack. [SEP]
[CLS] Skygofree: Following in the footsteps of <e1>HackingTeam</e1> At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of <e2>WhatsApp</e2> messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. [SEP]
[CLS] Skygofree wasn’t created from scratch as <e2>Kaspersky</e2> noted “it looks like the attackers created this exploit payload based on android-rooting-tools project source code.” In another instance, the researchers “found some code similarities between the implant for Windows and other public accessible projects. It appears the developers have copied the functional part of the keylogger module from this project.” How victims are infected This spyware is being used for targeted surveillance; all known targets have been located in Italy. Victims are infected after being lured to visit specific malicious sites meant to look like those of mobile operators. Once there, the target is infected with “sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device.” Just because surveillance features haven’t been seen before doesn’t mean the Android spyware is new. In fact, Kaspersky believes the malware was created at least by the end of 2014. Kaspersky discovered it in October 2017 and noted that one of the domains used to spread the spyware was registered by the attackers that same month. However, the domains hosting fake mobile operator sites were registered in 2015; that is the year Kaspersky said the distribution campaign was “most active” – it is also the year the Hacking Team was hacked. Italian company behind Skygofree Kaspersky didn’t go so far as to say which company is behind Skygofree, it is “pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like <e1>HackingTeam</e1>.” Various artifacts in the code referenced “negg;” Forbes’ sources claimed the Rome-based Negg is “working with the police now” to fill “the gap left behind by Hacking Team.

[CLS] XLoader distributed via DNS domains XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or <e2>Chrome</e2> apps. These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices. Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges. After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware. This malware campaign was targeting victims in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and FakeSpy have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the <e1>Yanbian Gang</e1> noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018.

[CLS] Once infected by the <e1>Ursnif</e1> malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND]. Each of the domains hosting the fake Google Play pages used similar words or typo-squatting to appear legitimate. Some examples are: google.servlce.store gooogle.services goooogle.services play.google.servlce.store play.gooogle.services play.goooogle.services. These malicious domains have been flagged on VirusTotal for a few months, with more reports accumulating over time. Reports on the malicious Android Packages (APKs) that conceal the Cerberus malware spread in this campaign have been flagging it since at least <e2>late-2020</e2>. In cases of users who do not successfully scan the QR code, they are asked to provide their telephone number and subsequently receive an SMS message with a download link to fetch the malicious application, which warns users about a potential service interruption if they fail to obtain the app. [SEP]

(Researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014.) The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations. Based on the leaked code, the RCSAndroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

[CLS] ” Precaution against <e2>TangleBot</e2> NCC says that the one important precaution against any malware (not just TangleBot) is for users to remain skeptical of text messages, especially unsolicited ones that require further clicks. Android users, who are the prime targets, should also be on the lookout for suspicious messages and be wary of clicking links that require personal information or some sort of end user input. “NCC hereby reiterates that mobile users are under obligation to practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact. Indeed, it is important to be judicious when downloading apps by reading install prompts closely, looking out for information regarding rights and privileges that the app may request.”-NCC Although TangleBot protects itself deletion, experts say, users can manually remove it from their device by using Android’s safe boot. Users, who have clicked a suspicious link, can restart their phone and then reboot the device in safe mode. In the system settings, users can also restore the factory setting of their device. Users can also report SMS phishing and spam. Use the spam reporting feature in the messaging client if it has one, or forward spam text messages to 7726, which spells “SPAM” on the phone keypad. Users should not install any software on their mobile device outside a certified app store from the vendor or Mobile Network Operator. Conclusion The ability to detect installed apps, app interactions, and inject overlay screens can be extremely problematic. As outlined earlier, malware such as <e1>FluBot</e1> and TangleBot can overlay banking or financial apps and directly steal the victim’s account credentials. [SEP]

[CLS] Evil Eye Threat Actor Resurfaces with iOS Exploit and Updated Implant In September 2019, <e1>Volexity</e1> published Digital Crackdown: Large-Scale Surveillance and Exploitation of Uyghurs, which described a series of attacks against Uyghurs from multiple Chinese APT actors. The most notable threat actor detailed in the blog was one Volexity calls Evil Eye. The Evil Eye threat actor was observed launching an exploit aimed at installing a malware implant on Android phones. Volexity also believed this was likely the same group responsible for the launching exploits aimed at installing an iOS implant as described by Google's Project Zero. Immediately after the publications from Google and Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor went fairly quiet. They removed their malicious code from compromised websites, command and control (C2) servers were taken down, and various hostnames stopped resolving. This largely remained the case until early January 2020, when Volexity observed a series of new activity across multiple previously compromised Uyghur websites. In the latest activity identified by Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor used an open source framework called IRONSQUIRREL to launch their exploit chain. The exploits used targeted <e2>Apple</e2> iOS operating systems leveraging a vulnerability in WebKit that appears to have been patched in the summer of 2019. [SEP]
[CLS] The Android app, called "TrickMo" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware.

"In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called <e1>ZitMo</e1> that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication.

[CLS] ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a <e2>banking trojan</e2>. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after banking app users. Trend Micro mobile threat analyst Tony Bao discovered a variant of Anubis (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_AnubisDropper) of the same type a few months ago. The Anubis variant analyzed in <e1>Bao</e1>’s research targeted 188 banking- and finance-related apps. [SEP]

[CLS] However, researchers at the Toronto-based <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the Mexican government has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes. Its founder and CEO, Shalev Hulio, has justified targeting lawyers and journalists. The company is facing multiple lawsuits in Israel and Cyprus over alleged abuse of its spy tools. As the Next Web noted, cloud adoption worldwide is accelerating at a rapid pace, making vulnerabilities such as the one identified in the Times report critical ones.

[CLS] Another 12 per cent are based in <e2>Europe</e2>. Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that <e1>Google</e1> has been fighting in earnest for the last year. [SEP]
[CLS] EXODUS ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by <e1>Italian app maker Connexxa</e1>, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from Security Without Borders found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local Italian internet service provider (ISP). They said the spyware was capable of rooting Android devices and possessed an advanced set of spying features that gave attackers full control of infected devices. Security Without Borders said it detected nearly 25 different Exodus-infected apps that had been uploaded on the Play Store over the last two years. LESS-SOPHISTICATED EXODUS IOS VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit conference, the team at Lookout said it discovered an iOS variant of this spyware during their analysis of Exodus samples they've found last year. "Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port," Lookout security researcher Adam Bauer said in a report published today. <e2>Bauer</e2> said the iOS version was being offered for download through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers.

Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan Anubis – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at Lookout warned in a new report. And it’s not just customers of big banks at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted. <e1>Infosec</e1> Insiders Newsletter “As a banking trojan malware, Anubis’ goal is to collect significant data about the victim from their mobile device for financial gain,” the Lookout report said.

[CLS] On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that <e2>maza-in</e2> and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: <e1>ExoBot</e1> Gustuff DiseaseBot Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

[CLS] Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1> suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich. Rather, it was downloaded later when the user was interacting with the app. With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. Andrew Blaich, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while ViperRAT apps had about a thousand combined installs. What those may seem like a low numbers, Blaich said Desert Scorpion "is a part of a targeted attack and not used for broad global-wide surveillance," and that "this number is in line with what we would expect." After Lookout reached out, Google removed the apps from the app store. "When we were notified by Lookout, we removed the apps from Play and updated <e2>Play Protect</e2> to help ensure users are secured," said a Google spokesperson. [SEP]
[CLS] “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which <e2>Tamer Almisshal</e2>’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and <e1>Center-2</e1>, spied on one and three phones, respectively.

The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times.

[CLS] As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as <e2>online banking</e2> credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] Lookout Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East <e2>Lookout</e2> researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as Desert Scorpion in the Google Play Store. Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

[CLS] Upon scanning, it was discovered that <e2>SpyNote</e2> doesn’t require root access in order to take full control of an infected device. Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that’s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won’t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card. The researchers also found SpyNote’s sample scanned on VirusTotal.

[CLS] The UAE did not immediately respond to a <e1>Post</e1> request for comment. One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed Pegasus, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of <e2>National Security Agency</e2> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. [SEP]

As the <e1>Next Web</e1> noted, cloud adoption worldwide is accelerating at a rapid pace, making vulnerabilities such as the one identified in the Times report critical ones. [SEP]
[CLS] Report: NSO Group's <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday. According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. <e2>Facebook</e2> said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers. [SEP]
[CLS] While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including <e1>Bank of America</e1>, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, <e2>SunTrust</e2>, and Wells Fargo. [SEP]
[CLS] Petersburg, <e1>Russia-based company, Special Technology Centre, Ltd.</e1> (STC, Ltd. or STC).” Special Technology Centre Ltd. (STC) has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. Monokle supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses <e2>Android</e2> accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Snapchat. [SEP]
[CLS] "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. <e1>Lookout</e1> has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (STC), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being "complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities" against the <e2>US</e2>. The defense contractor is one of three companies sanctioned for providing material support to the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) in election interference campaigns. [SEP]
[CLS] This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by <e1>Cerberus</e1> to give itself more permissions without user interaction. Having control of the Accessibility Services, the malware proceeds to ensure its persistence in different ways, either by disabling Play Protect or by removing itself from the applications in use. On the other hand, Cerberus is capable of generating an instance of TeamViewer on mobile, and through the aforementioned Accessibility permissions, authorizing said session while the equipment is in use, all without user interaction. From that point, and as soon as the C2 server has the computer’s data, the rest of the functionalities are available to the attackers remotely. Abusing both the Accessibility Service and the TeamViewer session, Cerberus is capable of a lot. Its possibilities include: A keylogger Listing, retrieval, sending and forwarding of SMS Forwarding or transferring calls Installation and deletion of apps Locking and unlocking the screen (without user interaction) Collection of device data List of device applications Device file collection and extraction Phishing attacks via preloaded overlays Various protection capabilities, such as emulation detection The rocky history of Cerberus As we mentioned, Cerberus has been on the market for a long time, to the detriment of users and banks alike. However, there are two reasons why it is now a growing concern: on one hand, the rapid evolution of its functionalities and on the other, the release of its source code. Cerberus was born in 2019 as an espionage suite. While its design made it capable of bank fraud, at the time the malware lacked the level of sophistication required to steal two-step authentication (2FA) data from apps like Google Authenticator. However, a <e2>ThreatFabric</e2> report analyzed the second version of the malware in early 2020. [SEP]

[CLS] Cerberus and <e1>Alien</e1>: the malware that has put Android in a tight spot The most complex Android malware in recent years has released its source code and malicious actors have their own forks, strongly motivated by financial gain. Is 2020 the year of smartphone malware? 2020 is the year of the rat, and we actually aren’t talking about the Chinese horoscope. According to several cybersecurity researchers, 2020 has seen an explosive increase in Remote access Trojans, or “RATs”. This threat is not minor: a RAT can take control of your computer in the same way that a remote administrator would normally do, using tools such as TeamViewer or VNC. In this case, it’s a malicious control: a RAT steals your personal information trying to carry out bank or identity fraud. However, and with the migration of PC users to the mobile world, hackers changed their strategy. Now there is a whole series of malware focused on bank credentials and identity theft, especially designed for Android mobile devices. These RATs have reached a high level of sophistication, and most are offered in the form of “malware as a service”, or MaaS. Between 2019 and 2020 these attacks have become increasingly common. Names like Anubis, Hydra, <e2>Ginp</e2>, or Gustuff appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. [SEP]
[CLS] Most infections (40 per cent) are in <e2>Asia</e2>, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in North America, Shaulov said. Another 12 per cent are based in Europe. Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that <e1>Google</e1> has been fighting in earnest for the last year. [SEP]
[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the <e2>Caucasus</e2> regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called Ahrar Maps made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham. “There is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,” according to the report. “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.” In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to <e1>Special Technology Center (STC)</e1>, a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U. [SEP]
[CLS] The Android app, called "<e1>TrickMo</e1>" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware. "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," IBM researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in <e2>2011</e2> to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. [SEP]
[CLS] <e2>Check Point</e2> researchers discovered another widespread malware campaign on Google Play, Google’s official app store. The malware, dubbed “Judy”, is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a <e1>Korean company</e1>. The malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements, generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it. [SEP]
[CLS] " The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. <e2>Lookout</e2> said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the <e1>Israeli Defense Force</e1> this time around, but did not name a new target. [SEP]
[CLS] We believe that this is the reason the <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> trojan requests the user to allow “Modify system settings”. Subsequently, the malware will change the screen off time-out to 10 minutes. This means that, unless victims lock their devices via the hardware button, the timer provides plenty of time for the malware to remotely perform malicious, in-app operations. If the device gets locked, the malware can’t unlock it. Malware data leak When we analyzed the sample, we realized that the malware operators left the remote database with some of the victims’ data freely accessible, without any authentication. The database contained the last activity performed on around 60 compromised devices. We found no other information stolen from the victims to be accessible. Thanks to this data leak, we were able to confirm that the malware really worked as designed: the attacker had access to the victims’ entered credentials, displayed or written emails and messages, etc. Once we reached the non-secured database, we were able to directly observe the app’s malicious behavior. To illustrate the level of threat the DEFENSOR ID app posed, we performed three tests. First, we launched a banking app and entered the credentials there. The credentials were immediately available in the leaky database – see Figure 6. Second, we wrote a test message in an email client. We saw the message uploaded to the attackers’ server within a second – see Figure 7. Third, we documented the trojan retrieving the <e2>Google Authenticator</e2> 2FA code. [SEP]
[CLS] The samples sharing this overlap are modified versions of an open source <e1>Jabber/XMPP</e1> client called “Conversations” with some code additions. The legitimate version of this app is also available on Google Play. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it. This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind ViceLeaker for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes. All the detections of this backdoored app were geolocated in <e2>Iran</e2>. Backdoored Conversations C2 server analysis During the analysis of the Smali injected apps and their C2 server infrastructure we hadn’t found any interesting clues, but things changed when we looked at the C2 server of the linked Conversations messenger.

[CLS] This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called <e2>eSurv S.R.L</e2>. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of <e1>Connexxa</e1> and was leased to eSurv S. [SEP]
[CLS] In those newly found samples the authors revisited the C2 communication protocol, added some new string protection techniques, renamed the side-loaded module filename to bare his nickname and added the TeamViewer based <e2>RAT</e2> function. Despite some minor refactoring, the architecture of the Trojan stayed the same. At the same time, the Cerberus team was making announcements about a soon-to-be-published second version of the Trojan in their commercial topic in an underground forum. Therefore, we initially assumed that the samples discovered are in fact the first/test versions of that advertised new version of the Trojan and classified them as such. That held until 5 days later. Enter the ring On January 18th, we discovered an interesting new post from another actor in an underground forum. This actor, whose name matches the newly introduced module name for the malware in question, started to advertise his own private malware with VNC feature. For the sake of clarity: Although VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a specific graphical desktop-sharing system, threat actors often label all Trojans with remote access capabilities (RAT) as embedding VNC, regardless of the technology being used. This discovery also matched the fact that the newly found samples included the RAT feature, making use of TeamViewer to provide remote access to the infected device. The highly relatable codebase, showing the strong links between this new Trojan and Cerberus was conflicting with the fact that this Trojan was clearly operated by a separate group, therefore we decide to investigate the situation further. Luckily, it was only a matter of weeks before we could confirm what was going on. Meet the Duke In February, it became apparent that the new malware was operated separately and slightly differently than Cerberus. We started to see simultaneous campaigns using both Trojans. Additionally, the malware described by its apparent author was enriched by a 2FA stealing technique that was capable of stealing secret tokens from Google’s Authenticator application, while Cerberus didn’t have such a feature. Mid-February, the actor who later proclaimed himself author of the <e1>BlackRock</e1> malware left a review on the profile of the apparent author, reviewing his malware-rental service: On February 20th 2020, the Cerberus actors made a promotional post in their commercial topic that referenced researchers, sharing the samples of what they thought was the Cerberus malware.

[CLS] The Cerberus malware component of the attack is used by Ursnif’s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks to their users when account updates and money transfer transactions are being confirmed in real-time. <e1>Cerberus</e1> also possesses other features and can enable the attacker to obtain the lock-screen code and remotely control the device. Cerberus is an overlay-type mobile malware that emerged in mid-2019 but initially lacked advanced capabilities. It has evolved over time to eventually feature the ability to hijack SMS content and control devices remotely, alongside other sophisticated data theft features. Cerberus was peddled in the underground as commodity malware until the summer of 2020, taking over the market share of Anubis, a previous pay-per-use malware. In September 2020, Cerberus’ development team decided to disband, spurring an auction attempt that aimed to sell off the source code to the highest bidder, starting at $100,000. The code did not sell but was instead shared with the malware’s customer base, which meant it was publicly leaked. That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving Cerberus and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a <e2>security app</e2>. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. [SEP]
[CLS] Disguises used by <e2>Anubis</e2> where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities <e1>Razdel</e1> (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] Expect a visit from the police Law enforcement agencies across Europe have searched homes this week, as part of an international crackdown against users of a notorious piece of Android malware known as DroidJack. <e1>Droidjack</e1> is a remote access trojan (RAT). If you’re a jealous partner, or thinking of stalking someone’s activity and movements, then DroidJack could be just the ticket – as it allows you to take remote control of someone else’s Android device without them noticing, recording private conversations, reading emails, browser history and text messages, as well as tracking their physical location. Maybe the news that police have raided and searched at least thirteen homes in a pan-European investigation will make some potential DroidJack purchasers think twice. According to reports, action was taken in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, targeting people who had bought DroidJack and used it since 2014. According to a BBC News report, searches were also conducted in the <e2>United States</e2>. Just to be clear, the action does not appear to have seen computer crime investigators hunting and apprehending the authors of DroidJack, but instead taking a long hard look at the people who had purchased the software and used it to spy upon others.

[CLS] In a recent analysis, our team found that an Ursnif (aka <e1>Gozi</e1>) banking Trojan variant is being used in the wild to target online banking users in Italy with mobile malware. Aside from the Ursnif infection on the victim’s desktop, the malware tricks victims into fetching a mobile app from a fake Google Play page and infects their mobile device with the Cerberus Android malware. The Cerberus malware component of the attack is used by Ursnif’s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks to their users when account updates and money transfer transactions are being confirmed in real-time. Cerberus also possesses other features and can enable the attacker to obtain the lock-screen code and remotely control the device.

[CLS] The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address <e2>Turkish</e2> users. With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.K. U.S. While there were 10 downloader apps in the Google Play Store at the time of this writing, the campaign is rather hefty. X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster’s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. IBM X-Force reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. Malicious apps are a blight that both store operators and developers work hard to limit. Still, it is a recurring problem: In 2017, X-Force mobile researchers reported numerous occasions on which financial malware had sneaked into the Google Play Store, with the <e1>BankBot</e1> Android malware family leading the pack.

[CLS] Insidious Android malware gives up all malicious features but one to gain stealth ESET researchers have analyzed an extremely dangerous Android app that can perform a host of nefarious actions, notably wiping out the victim’s bank account or cryptocurrency wallet and taking over their email or <e2>social media</e2> accounts. Called “DEFENSOR ID”, the banking trojan was available on Google Play at the time of the analysis. The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however, this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable Android’s Accessibility Service – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality. The <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> app made it onto the heavily guarded Google Play store thanks to its extreme stealth. [SEP]
[CLS] On August 17, two forum members named “<e1>ermac</e1>” and “DukeEugene” started advertising the malware. “DukeEugene”, posted the following message in his account: “Android botnet ERMAC. I will rent a new android botnet with wide functionality to a narrow circle of people (10 people). 3k$ per month. Details in PM.” DukeEugene is threat actor known to be behind the BlackRock banking Trojan. ERMAC differs from Cerberus in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm. “Despite the usage of different obfuscation techniques and new method of string encryption – using Blowfish encryption algorithm, we can definitely state that ERMAC is another Cerberus-based trojan.” reads the analysis published by Threatfabric. “Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts. clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device At the time of writing, ThreatFabric researchers with the help of support @malwrhunterteam experts determine that ERMAC is only targeting Poland, where is being distributed under the guise of delivery service and government applications. The new banking trojan can target over three hundred banking and mobile apps. “The story of ERMAC shows one more time how malware source code leaks can lead not only to slow evaporation of the malware family but also bring new threats/actors to the threat landscape. Being built on Cerberus basement, ERMAC introduces couple of new features. Although it lacks some powerful features like RAT, it remains a threat for <e2>mobile banking</e2> users and financial institutions all over the world. [SEP]
[CLS] “Our research shows that the <e1>APT-C-23</e1> group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in 2017 by several security research teams. Meanwhile, the updated version, Android/SpyC23.A, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the “DigitalApps” store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the “DigitalApps” store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from <e2>social media</e2> and messaging apps. [SEP]
[CLS] Ginp Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as <e1>AndroidOS_Ginp.HRXB</e1>) to steal user login credentials and credit card details. ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "<e2>Google Play Verificator</e2>" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. [SEP]
[CLS] Newer <e2>banking trojan</e2> apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Like Anubis, <e1>EventBot</e1> is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. [SEP]
[CLS] Dubbed <e1>Spynote</e1> by the researcher, the trojan targets those users who install apps in APK format, the process of downloading apps in APK format on Android devices is known as “sideloading” which is only possible if the user has allowed “Unknown Sources” in their security settings. The SpyNote RAT was found being discussed on several underground hacking forums by the researchers which, after analyzing turned out to be a bigger threat than expected. Upon scanning, it was discovered that SpyNote doesn’t require root access in order to take full control of an infected device. Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that’s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won’t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card. The researchers also found SpyNote’s sample scanned on VirusTotal. The Unit 42 also noted that SpyNot OmniRat and DroidJack. OmniRat was detected in 2015 targeting MAC, <e2>Windows</e2> or Andriod operating system while DroidJack RAT was found also found in fake Pokémon Go apps on Android store. [SEP]
[CLS] Here are some of the features of RCSAndroid include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger. <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> Android hacking tool had been in the wild since 2012 and has been known to Citizen Lab researchers since last year when the security firm detailed a Hacking Team backdoor used against Android users in Saudi Arabia. How RCSAndroid hacking tool infects a Target? RCSAndroid uses two different methods to infect targeted Android devices. 1. Hacking Team used text and email messages containing specially crafted URLs that triggered exploits for several vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-2825 and CVE-2012-2871) present in the default browsers of Android 4.0 Ice Cream to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing the attacker to gain root privileges, and install the RCSAndroid APK. 2. The company used backdoor apps such as "BeNews" available on the official Google Play Store to take advantage of a local privilege escalation bug to root the device and install the RCSAndroid agent. RCSAndroid has 4 'critical components': Penetration solutions – Methods to get into the device, either via SMS or email or a legitimate app Low-level native code – Advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android's security framework High-level Java agent – The application's malicious APK Command-and-control (C&C) servers – Servers used to remotely send or receive malicious commands Given that the source code of RCSAndroid is now available to everybody, it will likely put Android users in danger. So, if you own a smartphone running any Android version from 4.0 Ice Cream to 4.3 Jelly Bean, you need to 'Get Rid of it Today.' "The leaked RCSAndroid code is a commercial weapon now in the wild," security researchers wrote in a blog post. "Mobile users are called on to be on top of this news and be on guard for signs of monitoring. Some indicators may come in the form of peculiar behavior such as unexpected rebooting, finding unfamiliar apps installed, or instant <e2>messaging apps</e2> suddenly freezing. [SEP]
[CLS] Cerberus and <e1>Alien</e1>: the malware that has put Android in a tight spot The most complex Android malware in recent years has released its source code and malicious actors have their own forks, strongly motivated by financial gain. Is 2020 the year of smartphone malware? 2020 is the year of the rat, and we actually aren’t talking about the Chinese horoscope. According to several cybersecurity researchers, 2020 has seen an explosive increase in Remote access Trojans, or “RATs”. This threat is not minor: a RAT can take control of your computer in the same way that a remote administrator would normally do, using tools such as TeamViewer or <e2>VNC</e2>. In this case, it’s a malicious control: a RAT steals your personal information trying to carry out bank or identity fraud. [SEP]
[CLS] Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaws in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and Citizen Lab at the <e1>University of Toronto</e1>’s Munk School of Global Affairs. "This is the most sophisticated bad actor we have ever seen targeting mobile phones out in the wild," said Mike Murray, vice president of security research at Lookout. The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. "We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits," the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. "The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes," the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2> jails. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers believe that some of TrickMo’s functionalities, specifically the ability to record targeted applications, help the trojan obtain a one-time password (OTP) or transaction authentication number, with the goal of bypassing 2FA protections put in place by <e2>banks</e2>. “We believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app-recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks,” they said. Bypassing Authentication In most places, 2FA is implemented by sending an SMS message containing a OTP to a user’s mobile device. However, SMS messages, as previous hacks have proved, can be intercepted. So, some banks in Europe (and especially in Germany) have taken these types of authentication measures a step further by using an app that sends push notifications to users (rather than texts). These notifications would contain the transaction details and the passcode. In Germany, the one-time security codes required to log in to mobile banking are known as a mobile TANs (mTANs), and the apps that do the push notifications are known as “pushTAN” apps. “The pushTAN method has a clear advantage: It improves security by mitigating the risk of SIM swapping attacks and SMS-stealers,” said researchers. “The pushTAN method is a hurdle for malware apps that may reside on the same device, and it’s particularly challenging for mobile malware due to Android’s application sandbox. This feature is designed to block one application from accessing the data of other applications without rooting the device.” TrickMo’s features are designed to bypass this extra type of authentication – specifically, via its ability to record mobile phone screens. This screen-recording feature abuses accessibility services in Android. Accessibility services were originally developed by <e1>Google</e1> to help users with disabilities. [SEP]

Capture real-time voice calls in any network or app by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service RCSAndroid in the Wild Our analysis reveals that this RCSAndroid (AndroidOS_RCSAgent.HRX) has been in the wild since 2012. Traces of its previous uses in the wild were found inside the configuration file: It was configured to use a Command-and-control (C&C) server in the United States; however, the server was bought from a host service provider and is now unavailable. It was configured to activate via SMS sent from a Czech Republic number. Attackers can send SMS with certain messages to activate the agent and trigger corresponding action. This can also define what kind of evidences to collect. Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of Czech firms appear to be in business with the Hacking team, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and <e2>heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871)</e2> vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4. [SEP]
[CLS] Web in <e2>Jan 2017</e2> and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities <e1>Razdel</e1> (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

Each of the observed exploit sites and malware C2 servers are detailed in Appendix A below. Targeting Website Visitors The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites. Volexity observed a total of six different hostnames being used to launch attacks between January and <e2>March 2020</e2>.

[CLS] For any reason, Rotexy Trojan Malware or <e2>Superservice</e2> could not switch off the phone screen when a user attempts to revoke the admin privileges then Rotexy Trojan try to intimidate the user. While Rotexy Trojan (Malware) Runs in User’s phone, it Tracks a few things: Rebooting and switching off the phone Termination of Rotexy Malware Trojan Sending of an SMS using the phone Rotexy Trojan Malware Communication: Default C&C server IP address 81[.]177[.]135[.]30 is written in Rotexy Malware Trojan’s code. This is the C&C server where Rotecy Trojan Malware will send the infected device information. Remdynamicallyamicaly generated subdomain can also be used. Rotexy Trojan Malware stores the information about the C&C server and infected device data in a local SQLite database. Once, Rotexy Trojan gets the admin privilege then it receives the information from the C&C server that how it needs to operate for example SMS interception templates and HTML page that it needs to show on the application. Rotexy Trojan (Malware) intercept all the incoming SMS and process them according to the templates it received from the C&C server. Rotexy Trojan also puts user’s phone in silent mode and switch of the screen when it received an SMS so the user doesn’t get notified about the incoming message. It can also send a message to the specific phone number with the information that has been received in SMS. With the general information, Rotexy trojan also sends other information to the C&C server like running process and application. It is also possible that it can detect banking applications. Rotexy Trojan will perform the following actions, once it receives the command from its C&C server: Start, Stop, Restart- start, stop and restart super service Unblock- unblock the user device and revoke the admin privileges URL- update the C&C address or IP Message- Send an SMS with a specified context to a specific phone number ONLINE- sends the current status of <e1>Rotexy Trojan</e1> (Application) CONTACTS- Send text received from the C&C server to all contacts, that is how this is spreading ALL_CONTACTS- send all contact details to the C&C server BLOCKER_BANKING_START- Block the display to show bank’s Phishing HTML page to enter the bank details BLOCKER_EXTORTIONIST_START- Block the display to show Ransome page BLOCKER_UPDATE_START- Block the Display to show device update BLOCKER_STOP- Block display of all HTML pages Rotexy Trojan Malware not only use the web browser, but it can also use any device that is able to send Text messages.

Rotexy Trojan Blocking the Display: User’s phone display has been blocked for a long duration by showing the fake updating page by Rotexy Trojan Malware. Rotexy Trojan Malware blocks the user’s phone display and shows a Ransome page with some sexually explicit image (that has been covered within a black box). Similarly, Rotexy Trojan Malware blocks the user phone screens and display banking page to enter the bank details. Once the user enters the bank detail it sends all information to the C&C server. As Rotexy Trojan already has control on your incoming messages and also received bank details then the attacker can perform any transaction or even can change password, ATM card Debit card PIN. How to unblock a Phone: Now, with this serious problem, the good news is Rotexy Trojan Malware processing module is not well designed. So, once a phone gets blocked then it can be unlocked by sending “3458” in an SMS to the number which is in the blocked phone. This SMS will revoke the admin access of this Trojan over the device then send another message “stop_blocker”. The second message will stop the screen <e2>blocker</e2> and leads to unlocking the user’s phone. [SEP]

MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In July 2016, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like OmniRat and <e1>DroidJack</e1>, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum.

[CLS] So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, <e2>Thailand</e2>, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]

[CLS] ” It’s actually the open nature of Android platform that invites threat actors to target them so persistently, since they have the ability to exploit its source code to create campaigns like this one, noted James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at <e2>KnowBe4</e2>. “Android devices are a prime target due to the number of people who own them and the operating system is open-source code, which allows cyber criminals to discover exploits for their malware attacks,” he said in an email to Threatpost.

[CLS] The samples sharing this overlap are modified versions of an open source <e1>Jabber/XMPP</e1> client called “Conversations” with some code additions. The legitimate version of this app is also available on Google Play. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers’ C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an <e2>Android</e2> IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications.

[CLS] “TrickMo uses accessibility services to identify and control some of these screens and make its own choices before giving the user a chance to react.” <e1>TrickBot</e1> Evolves Researchers said that this most recent evolution points to malware operators looking to switch up their tactics in bypassing banking authentication protections. “As banks release more advanced security measures, banking malware evolves to keep up with the perpetual arms race,” said researchers. “From our analysis of the TrickMo mobile malware, it is apparent that TrickMo is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in Germany.” It’s only the most recent tactic changeup for TrickBot. The operators of the infamous banking trojan have been busy over the past months. Earlier in March, the malware added a new feature, a module called rdpScanDLL, that brute forces remote desktop protocol (RDP) accounts. Also this past month, TrickBot added a <e2>Windows</e2> 10 ActiveX control to execute malicious macros. [SEP]

[CLS] Cerberus was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing <e1>Anubis</e1>’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the banking apps inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. Like any Remote Access Trojan worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside. Basically, Cerberus can intercept and steal your phone’s unlock pattern or PIN, as well as Google Authenticator numbers, and any SMS necessary to perform a two-step verification. Likewise, this malware can interpose itself between you and your bank’s app through an overlay, the most common method for carrying out a phishing attack. In short, Cerberus can enter your computer, extract all the necessary data to perform a bank fraud, and wait for the best moment to take the money from your account. All without you doing anything. Cerberus and its complex functionality Regarding what Cerberus can do, it is necessary to point out two possibilities within its functionality. We already mentioned that Cerberus is a RAT, but to achieve such control of the phone, it is necessary to have control of a vulnerability. In this case, it is the Android Accessibility Service. This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by Cerberus to give itself more permissions without user interaction. Having control of the Accessibility Services, the malware proceeds to ensure its persistence in different ways, either by disabling <e2>Play Protect</e2> or by removing itself from the applications in use.

[CLS] Ursnif Leverages Cerberus to Automate Fraudulent Bank Transfers in Italy <e2>June 23, 2021</e2> IBM Trusteer researchers continually monitor the evolution and attack tactics in the banking sector. In a recent analysis, our team found that an Ursnif (aka Gozi) banking Trojan variant is being used in the wild to target online banking users in Italy with mobile malware. Aside from the Ursnif infection on the victim’s desktop, the malware tricks victims into fetching a mobile app from a fake Google Play page and infects their mobile device with the Cerberus Android malware. The Cerberus malware component of the attack is used by Ursnif’s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks to their users when account updates and money transfer transactions are being confirmed in real-time. Cerberus also possesses other features and can enable the attacker to obtain the lock-screen code and remotely control the device. Cerberus is an overlay-type mobile malware that emerged in mid-2019 but initially lacked advanced capabilities. It has evolved over time to eventually feature the ability to hijack SMS content and control devices remotely, alongside other sophisticated data theft features. Cerberus was peddled in the underground as commodity malware until the summer of 2020, taking over the market share of <e1>Anubis</e1>, a previous pay-per-use malware. [SEP]

[CLS] Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. <e1>APT-C-23</e1> has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party. Palestine is a lightning rod of political controversy both around the world and domestically, as the territories of the West Bank and <e2>Gaza Strip</e2> have played host to an ongoing and deadly clash between Hamas and Fatah.

The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e1>“Android.BankBot.149.origin”</e1>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. [SEP]
[CLS] For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The HackingTeam’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection. When DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android devices. However, within six months the malicious actors added the capability to infect iOS devices. DualToy is still active and we have detected over 8,000 unique samples belonging to this Trojan family to date. It mainly targets Chinese users, but has also successfully affected people and organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain, and <e2>Ireland</e2>. In addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, DualToy also performs the following activities on Android and iOS devices: Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like AceDeceiver) Several years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to pair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy.

[CLS] The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, <e2>Switzerland</e2>, and Italy. Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. Once downloaded, EventBot amasses a carte blanche of permissions, including starting at bootup and maintaining a persistent background process allowing the app to monitor the smartphone continuously. The trojan also prevents the phone from sleeping and ignores battery optimization settings. EventBot also obtains control of Android’s accessibility services to run a keylogger, receive notifications as well as retrieve the content of open windows. Although still in the development stage, the app may be a more significant threat to mobile banking compared to Anubis. Cybercriminals have discovered a lucrative target in the Android mobile banking and shopping industry. Despite Google’s effort to keep malicious apps out of the Play Store, threat actors can still distribute the apps through third-party stores. Maybe this is the moment <e1>Google</e1> should reconsider allowing app installation through untrusted sources. [SEP]
[CLS] Of note, the target <e2>banks</e2> are in the U.S., France and Japan—a fairly specific list of countries. ESET security researcher Lukas Stefanko told me he "found Cerberus in June, a couple of days after it was published on an underground forum." Stefanko used Twitter to ask the research community if anyone had come across it before, "and that is when I noticed their twitter handle joined the debate under my tweet." "Even though they know I am android malware analyst," Stefanko told me, "they tried to sell me their Cerberus bot. They created a profile where the only thing I needed to do is buy it. However my goal was to obtain working sample and C&C address to properly analyze it." The developers sent Stefanko a sample of Cerberus, but used his Twitter handle "instead of a real C&C server," and so he was unable to test it. Two days later, Stefanko and colleagues "detected an active campaign using this new banking Trojan with thousands of website visits that contained the payload. Cerberus was spread via a fake website that asked users to install Adobe Flash Player." Stefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used "a web framework where anyone can check website visit statistics—because of that I found out which countries are targeted with actual number of site visits." Over a fourteen day period, Stefanko tracked more than 13,000 visits to the fake Cerberus website, most of which were from users in the U.S. and Japan. At about the same time, Cerberus was seen being rented out in underground forums by the team at <e1>ThreatFabric</e1>. The malware's developers claimed it had been used privately for two years beforehand, and that it was "written from scratch" and does not "borrow" code from existing malware, making it harder to detect. [SEP]
[CLS] Somewhat later, the <e1>BlackRock</e1> actor replied to the post, condemning the Cerberus actors for taking credit for another malware project, stating that it was a different malware that he uses himself: Thoughtfully, he included some screenshots with proof: The tweet made by @pr3wtd that sparked that truly insightful conversation, clearly links provided IOCs with the sample of the malware that the BlackRock author was testing at the time, the Trojan advertised by the actor we already envisaged being author. That sample indeed belongs to the same malware strain that we discovered earlier January. The revelation After we established a solid link between the actor running the private rental service and the samples, the only aspect we were missing was the name of the Trojan. Fortunately for us, after a while topics showing interest in a certain “Alien” malware started to appear in the underground forum and the author himself confirmed his affiliation to, and the name of, the Trojan: Based on our in-depth knowledge of the Trojan (available in our Mobile Threat Intelligence portal), we can prove that the Alien malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early January 2020 and rented out at the same time as Cerberus. Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters. Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app. The code of that feature code is almost identical to that introduced with the Alien Trojan in <e2>February 2020</e2>. This indicates that at that time, the developer behind the Cerberus Trojan had access to, and might have been responsible for development of the Alien code. [SEP]

On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e2>ZergHelper</e2>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]
[CLS] Pegasus is a mobile phone-surveillance solution that enables customers to remotely exploit and monitor devices. <e2>NSO Group</e2> has long maintained that its mobile spyware is meant to be a tool for governments to use in fighting crime and terror, and that it’s not complicit in any government’s misuse of it. Critics however say that repressive governments use it for more nefarious purposes to track dissidents, journalists and other members of civil society — and that NSO Group assists them. The latest version of the Pegasus implant has a number of capabilities, according to Citizen Lab, including: Recording audio from the microphone including both ambient “hot mic” recording and audio of encrypted phone calls; taking pictures; tracking device location; and accessing passwords and stored credentials. KISMET Citizen Lab’s analysis of the attacks, released Sunday, found that the attackers found a footing on the phones from which to install Pegasus by exploiting a zero-day in Apple’s iMessage feature for iPhone. “The phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call KISMET, which appears to involve an invisible zero-click exploit in iMessage,” researchers said in the Sunday posting. “In July 2020, KISMET was a zero-day against at least iOS 13.5.1 and could hack Apple’s then-latest iPhone 11.” Ctizen Lab noted that the zero-day was likely also brokered by NSO Group. “NSO Group is shifting towards zero-click exploits and network-based attacks that allow its government clients to break into phones without any interaction from the target, and without leaving any visible traces,” researchers said, citing the 2019 WhatsApp breach, where at least 1,400 phones were targeted via an exploit sent through a missed voice call. NSO Group has denied its involvement in that case. <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of Pegasus’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime messages or notifications.

[CLS] First Twitter‑controlled Android botnet discovered Detected by ESET as <e1>Android/Twitoor</e1>, this malware is unique because of its resilience mechanism. Instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server, it receives instructions via tweets. Android/Twitoor is a backdoor capable of downloading other malware onto an infected device. It has been active for around one month. This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of Android/Twitoor.A, can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one. “Using Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” says Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. Malware that enslaves devices to form botnets needs to be able to receive updated instructions. That communication is an Achilles heel for any botnet – it may raise suspicion and, cutting the bots off is always lethal to the botnet’s functioning. Additionally, should the command-and-control (C&C) servers get seized by the authorities, it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet. To make the Twitoor botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it’s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,” explains Štefanko. In the <e2>Windows</e2> space, Twitter, founded in 2006, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. [SEP]
[CLS] He added that: “The disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission’s <e2>New Media and Information Security Department</e2> by the Nigerian <e1>Computer Emergency Response Team</e1> (ngCERT). [SEP]
[CLS] The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however, this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable Android’s <e2>Accessibility Service</e2> – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality.

[CLS] The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google <e2>Play</e2> malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of Anubis 2 was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. During Q1 2019, actor maza-in vanished from the threat landscape, leaving existing customers without support and updates. Although exact details about the vanishing of the actor remain unclear at the time of writing, a chain of events confirms that some abnormal activity took place around Anubis and its author. On December 13 2018 maza-in announces the release of Anubis 2.5; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code. On January 16 2019 Anubis code is leaked in an underground forum (both backend code and unobfuscated APK). On February 14 2019 for the first time an Anubis sample seen targeting Russian banks only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator). On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “<e1>Anubis 3</e1>” malware on an underground forum. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Anubis</e1> Android Malware Is Back and It Is Focusing on Financial Institutions The Most Recent Operations Affects Roughly 400 Targets. In a recent malware operation, the Anubis Android banking malware is targeting clients of approximately 400 banking institutions. The cybercriminals are attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency wallets, and digital payment systems by posing as an Orange S.A. Android application intended to collect information such as: browsing cookies, passwords saved on browsers, credit card details. More on Anubis Malware Anubis is a mobile malware that affects Android smartphones and is spread using malicious apps listed on the legitimate Google Play store. The banking malware initially surfaced on Russian hacking forums in 2016, where it was distributed as an open-source banking trojan with guidance on how to set up the client and components. In 2019, the malware introduced what seemed to be a nearly working ransomware component and spread using fraudulent apps on Google’s Play Store. Anubis reappeared last year with large-scale phishing attacks that targeted 250 shopping and financial applications. Anubis M.O. When potential victims access apps for targeted platforms, Anubis malware will show bogus phishing login forms in order to steal their credentials. The overlay screen shown below will be displayed over the genuine app’s login screen to trick users into assuming it’s a valid login form when, in fact, the hackers are receiving their credentials. According to <e2>BleepingComputer</e2>, the latest version of Anubis targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a keylogger login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device.

Update as of July 23, 2015 1:00 AM PDT (UTC-7) We have added a link to a previous report discussing this threat. Timeline of posts related to the Hacking Team DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their Remote Control System (RCS) agent installed in their targets’ systems. July 14 A new zero-day vulnerability (<e2>CVE-2015-2425</e2>) was found in Internet Explorer. [SEP]

Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email.

[CLS] “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to <e1>Pegasus</e1> installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, <e2>Center-1</e2> and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.

[CLS] These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families. What it does The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The chat application acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app. At the time of writing Lookout has observed two updates to the Dardesh application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28. The malicious capabilities observed in the second stage include the following: Upload attacker-specified files to C2 servers Get list of installed applications Get device metadata Inspect itself to get a list of launchable activities Retrieves PDF, txt, doc, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx files found on external storage Send SMS Retrieve text messages Track device location Handle limited attacker commands via out of band text messages Record surrounding audio Record calls Record video Retrieve account information such as email addresses Retrieve contacts Removes copies of itself if any additional APKs are downloaded to external storage. Call an attacker-specified number Uninstall apps Check if a device is rooted Hide its icon Retrieve list of files on external storage If running on a Huawei device it will attempt to add itself to the protected list of apps able to run with the screen off Encrypts some exfiltrated data Desert Scorpion's second stage masquerades as a generic "settings" application.

The list of these original features is very limited compared to recent banking Trojans but enough to steal personal information from the victims: Overlaying: Dynamic - C2 based (possibility to remotely modify the list of targeted application) SMS blocking (hiding messages from the victim) SMS sending (capability to send messages from the infected device) SMS harvesting (possibility to send a copy of all message to the C2 server) About Anubis Rise of maza-in By publishing the aforementioned article, maza-in earned himself a reputation of Android expert on underground forums. He started to share tips and tricks to help other threat actors deal with technical issues and enhance their own malware. Shortly after the initial article, the actor even conducted an interview with <e2>Forbes</e2> magazine named “I Want To Expose Google’s Mistakes”, stating that he published the malicious code to improve the state of Android security, by showing design flaws in the system that can be easily abused.

This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events.

This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors as almost everyone on the planet carries at least one mobile device they interact with throughout any given day. Thanks to a relative lack of security controls applied to mobile devices, these devices have become very attractive targets for a broad range of malicious actors.

[CLS] “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. <e2>Kaspersky</e2> spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the U.S. reported the second largest attacks (17.17%) and Hong Kong stood third (4.81%).

[CLS] Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaws in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. "This is the most sophisticated bad actor we have ever seen targeting mobile phones out in the wild," said Mike Murray, vice president of security research at Lookout. The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm <e2>Francisco Partners</e2> in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security.

[CLS] Lookout Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as <e2>Desert Scorpion</e2> in the Google Play Store. Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

[CLS] On Friday, the <e1>BBC</e1> reported that British police had arrested a 28-year-old man from Carlisle, northern England, under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 in relation to the international investigation. A spokesperson for the U.K.'s National Crime Agency confirmed to Newsweek that the arrests were made by officers from the national cybercrime unit and that a number of digital devices were seized from the property. The suspect has now been released on bail. DroidJack has a large potential victim base—there are reportedly more than one billion Android users across the world. Android recorded a market share of 82.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, almost six times the size of the user base of Apple's iOS mobile system. Newsweek spoke to Sean Sullivan, security adviser at international online security company F-Secure, about the malware and how Android users can protect themselves. What is DroidJack? In cybersecurity parlance, DroidJack is known as a remote access tool, or RAT. Such tools allow the administrators of large computer networks to obtain access to individual devices from a remote location. However, when they are used maliciously to spy or obtain personal data, they are often referred to as remote access trojans. DroidJack is available to buy on the internet: the software's site, droidjack.net, advertises a lifetime package of the software for $210. Newsweek reached out to the software's founder, who named only as Sanjeevi and is based in <e2>India</e2>, about the purpose of the software. [SEP]
[CLS] TrickBot Pushing a 2FA Bypass App to Bank Customers in <e2>Germany</e2> IBM X-Force researchers analyzed an Android malware app that’s likely being pushed to infected users by the TrickBot Trojan. This app, dubbed “TrickMo” by our team, is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction. While it’s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app. According to our research, TrickMo is still under active development as we expect to see frequent changes and updates. While it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region, at this time, we are seeing it deployed specifically in Germany. Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016. In 2020, it appears that TrickBot’s vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts. First Signs in September 2019 In September 2019, a tweet by <e1>CERT-Bund</e1> caught the attention of the IBM Trusteer Mobile Security Research team. [SEP]
[CLS] At the time of writing <e1>Lookout</e1> has observed two updates to the Dardesh application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28. The malicious capabilities observed in the second stage include the following: Upload attacker-specified files to C2 servers Get list of installed applications Get device metadata Inspect itself to get a list of launchable activities Retrieves PDF, txt, doc, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx files found on external storage Send SMS Retrieve text messages Track device location Handle limited attacker commands via out of band text messages Record surrounding audio Record calls Record video Retrieve account information such as email addresses Retrieve contacts Removes copies of itself if any additional APKs are downloaded to external storage. Call an attacker-specified number Uninstall apps Check if a device is rooted Hide its icon Retrieve list of files on external storage If running on a Huawei device it will attempt to add itself to the protected list of apps able to run with the screen off Encrypts some exfiltrated data Desert Scorpion's second stage masquerades as a generic "settings" application. Curiously, several of these have included the world "Fateh" in their package name, which may be referring to the <e2>Fatah</e2> political party. [SEP]
[CLS] These stores are an attractive alternative to <e2>Google Play</e2> because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like <e1>Ghostpush</e1>, MonkeyTest, and Xinyinhe. [SEP]
[CLS] In addition, <e1>Monokle</e1> has the ability to install trusted certificates which allow it to gain root access to the device. This allows the attackers to deploy unique capabilities in their quest to steal data. Much of this is achieved by exploiting accessibility services and tailoring them to steal data from third-party applications, as well as using the predictive-text dictionaries of the user to gain insight into the kinds of topic that interest them. The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode. "Monokle is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software," Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told ZDNet. "It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device." While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (STC), a Russian company working out of <e2>St Petersburg</e2>. STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being "complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities" against the US. [SEP]
[CLS] The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, <e1>riveroer</e1>, and sdfkjhl2.) As of this writing, no files were hosted at any of the links. The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims. Use of a shared hosting service to distribute malware is highly flexible and low cost for the threat actors. It is also much harder for network defenders or researchers to track a campaign where the infrastructure is a moving target. Many top providers in Russia offer cheap prices for their shared hosting services, and some even provide free 30-day trial periods. Threat actors can register subdomains through the hosting provider and use the provider’s services for a short-period campaign. A few days later they can cancel the trial and do not need to pay a penny. In addition, these out-of-the-box hosting services usually provide better infrastructure than the attackers could manage to construct (or compromise) themselves. RuMMS Code Analysis All RuMMS samples share the same behaviors, major parts of which are shown in Figure 1. However, the underlying code can be quite different in that various obfuscation mechanisms were adopted to evade detection by anti-virus tools. We used a sample app named <e2>“org.starsizew”</e2> with an MD5 of d8caad151e07025fdbf5f3c26e3ceaff to analyze RuMMS’s code. [SEP]
[CLS] In total, 17,490 new samples of the malware have been found on two related servers by <e2>Trend Micro</e2>. Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. The majority of which appear to be Turkish, according to the language settings used by social media accounts sending commands. Once commands have been accepted, Anubis can hijack devices, steal data, and send information to command-and-control (C2) servers which have spread worldwide. The new variants are also able to detect if they are running on virtual machines (VMs), a common way for researchers to safely unpack and analyze malware. In Anubis' case, this also includes Android emulators such as Genymotion. Anubis is not the only Android malware variant which is being constantly improved and refined by its developers. Last week, Fortinet researchers said <e1>BianLian</e1> -- which began life as a dropper for Anubis and is now an established banking Trojan on its own accord -- is now bypassing Google Android protections to propagate its malicious code.

[CLS] Enter an <e2>Israeli</e2> technology firm, NSO Group. The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone. Pegasus is designed to infiltrate devices running Android, Blackberry, iOS and Symbian operating systems and turn them into surveillance devices. The company says it sells Pegasus only to governments and only for the purposes of tracking criminals and terrorists. How it works Earlier version of Pegasus were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities in commonly used apps or by spear-phishing, which involves tricking a targeted user into clicking a link or opening a document that secretly installs the software. It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or manually if an agent can steal the target’s phone. Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone’s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/<e1>Flickr</e1>, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss. [SEP]
[CLS] cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the <e2>United States</e2>, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the <e1>Fatah</e1> political party. [SEP]
[CLS] We used a sample app named <e2>“org.starsizew”</e2> with an MD5 of d8caad151e07025fdbf5f3c26e3ceaff to analyze RuMMS’s code. Several of the main components of RuMMS are shown in Figure 2. The activity class “org.starsizew.MainActivity” executes when the app is started. It first starts another activity defined in “org.starsizew.Aa” to request device administrator privileges, and then calls the following API of “android.content.pm.PackageManager” (the Android package manager to remove its own icon on the home screen in order to conceal the existence of RuMMS from the user: setComponentEnabledSetting(MainActivity.class, 2, 1) At the same time, ”org.starsizew.MainActivity” will start the main service as defined in <e1>“org.starsizew.Tb”,</e1> and use a few mechanisms to keep the main service running continuously in the background. [SEP]
[CLS] To make the <e1>Twitoor</e1> botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it’s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,” explains Štefanko. In the Windows space, Twitter, founded in 2006, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. Android bots have also already been found being controlled via other non-traditional means – blogs or some of the many cloud messaging systems like Google’s or Baidu’s – but Twitoor is the first Twitter-based bot malware, according to Štefanko. “In the future, we can expect that the bad guys will try to make use of Facebook statuses or deploy LinkedIn and other social networks”, states ESET’s researcher. Currently, the Twitoor trojan has been downloading several versions of <e2>mobile banking malware</e2>. However, the botnet operators can start distributing other malware, including ransomware, at any time warns Štefanko. [SEP]
[CLS] Xiao said, in order for the <e2>Trojan</e2> to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>FakeSpy</e1> Android Malware Disguised as Postal Service Messages The operators behind an updated version of the FakeSpy malware are targeting Android devices using SMS phishing messages to spread the info stealer, according to the security firm Cybereason. The SMS messages are designed to appear to come from legitimate postal and delivery services, including the U.S. Postal Service, the U.K. Royal Mail, DHL Group, France's Las Poste, Taiwan's <e2>Chunghwa Post</e2>, several private delivery companies in Japan as well as others in Switzerland and Germany, Cybereason researchers say. [SEP]
[CLS] EXODUS ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by <e1>Italian app maker Connexxa</e1>, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from <e2>Security Without Borders</e2> found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local Italian internet service provider (ISP). [SEP]
[CLS] The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like Pegasus or <e1>FinFisher</e1>. As we've seen with actors like Dark Caracal, this low cost, low sophistication approach that relies heavily upon social engineering has still been shown to be highly successful for those operating such campaigns. [SEP]

[CLS] Permission <e1>Alien</e1> uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself. It does this using an advanced remote access feature that compromises the TeamViewer application, giving the bad player behind the malware remote control over the victim’s devices. TeamViewer is a proprietary software application used for remote control, desktop & online meetings. Remote Control “When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access & change device settings, install & remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers & social networks),” outlined researchers. “By monitoring the device in real-time, actors can also gain valuable insight into the user’s behaviour.” It is not clear how Alien is first spread, but because the malware is being rented out, many different initial attack tactics can be used, including spear-phishing, & distribution through 3rd-party applications tec. The Link to Cerberus Cerberus first appeared last Aug. on underground forums, offered in a MaaS rental from. Then it was shown as a standard banking trojan. In July, the malware was uncovered in a malicious Android app on the Google Play app market, which had 10,000 downloads. Over the past 12 months many technical issues occurred that led to ‘unhappy customers’. The Cerberus makers thus decided to end the rental service, & refund active license holders. On <e2>Aug. 10</e2>, the malware author shared the source code of the trojan to the general public. [SEP]

Capture real-time voice calls in any network or app by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service RCSAndroid in the Wild Our analysis reveals that this RCSAndroid (AndroidOS_RCSAgent.HRX) has been in the wild since 2012. Traces of its previous uses in the wild were found inside the configuration file: It was configured to use a Command-and-control (C&C) server in the United States; however, the server was bought from a host service provider and is now unavailable. It was configured to activate via SMS sent from a Czech Republic number. Attackers can send SMS with certain messages to activate the agent and trigger corresponding action. This can also define what kind of evidences to collect. Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of Czech firms appear to be in business with the Hacking team, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and <e2>heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871)</e2> vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4. [SEP]

The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. <e1>Connexxa</e1> is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. [SEP]

[CLS] Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of <e1>SpyNote</e1> Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. Droidjack made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. OmniRat is similar in function and was first spotted in Germany in November by researchers who said targeted victims received a text message asking them to download an app to view an image. Once installed, SpyNote is hard to get rid of; it removes the SpyNote application icon from the victim’s phone and install new APKs and update the malware. “The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card,” according to a technical description of malware. Palo Alto has gleaned important details of SpyNote from what it identifies as a video demonstrating the capabilities of the malware. In the video hacking tutorial a user appears to be running SpyNote through its paces showing a remote takeover of an Android device. “The uploader might be following the instructions described in <e2>YouTube</e2> videos on using SpyNote, considering the port number used is exactly the same as in the videos and the uploader only changes the icon of the APK file,” wrote Jacob Soo.

[CLS] Millions of Google accounts breached by new <e2>Android</e2> malware Gooligan affects users of Android 4 and 5 and can be used to steal Google account credentials. Millions of Google accounts have been compromised in a new attack campaign that uses Android credentials to access data from Google services. The Gooligan malware is downloaded to smartphone devices through third-party app stores, security firm Check Point found. The apps could also be downloaded if the user clicks on a malicious link in a phishing message. AndroidFrom there, it proceeds to download a rootkit which exploits vulnerabilities in the user’s device to take it over. It then downloads a malicious module from a command and control (C&C) server which allows Gooligan to steal credentials for email and other services. In addition, the control can be used to install apps from Google Play and rate them using the user’s Google account or install adware on the user’s device to generate revenue. Devices that can be affected by the malware include Android 4 and Android 5, which Check Point says includes 74 percent of devices currently in use. Check Point is currently working with Google Security to find the source of the attack. Google said that it was taking steps to secure victims’ accounts, such as notifying those affected, revoking affected tokens and deploying SafetyNet improvements. GooliganAccording to Google, there is no evidence that user data has been accessed, and the credentials have been used primarily to promote apps. Google said that the malware was part of a family called <e1>Ghost Push</e1> all targeted at doing the same thing. [SEP]
[CLS] This threat is not minor: a RAT can take control of your computer in the same way that a remote administrator would normally do, using tools such as <e2>TeamViewer</e2> or VNC. In this case, it’s a malicious control: a RAT steals your personal information trying to carry out bank or identity fraud. However, and with the migration of PC users to the mobile world, hackers changed their strategy. Now there is a whole series of malware focused on bank credentials and identity theft, especially designed for Android mobile devices. These RATs have reached a high level of sophistication, and most are offered in the form of “malware as a service”, or MaaS. Between 2019 and 2020 these attacks have become increasingly common.

Timeline of posts related to the Hacking Team DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their Remote Control System (RCS) agent installed in their targets’ systems. July 14 A new zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-2425) was found in Internet Explorer. July 16 On the mobile front, a fake news app designed to bypass Google Play was discovered. July 20 A new zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-2426) was found in Windows, which <e2>Microsoft</e2> fixed in an out-of-band patch. [SEP]
[CLS] Examples of modern families based on <e1>Marcher</e1> are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape. The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in <e2>Europe</e2>, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

[CLS] Based on emails leaked in the dump, a number of <e1>Czech firms</e1> appear to be in business with the Hacking team, including a major IT partner in the Olympic Games. Dropping Cluster Bombs RCSAndroid is a threat that works like a cluster bomb in that it deploys multiple dangerous exploits and uses various techniques to easily infect Android devices. While analyzing the code, we found that the whole system consists of four critical components, as follows: penetration solutions, ways to get inside the device, either via SMS/email or a legitimate app low-level native code, advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android’s security framework high-level Java agent – the app’s malicious APK command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands Attackers use two methods to get targets to download RCSAndroid. The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871) vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing another local privilege escalation exploit to execute. When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices. <e2>Hacking Team</e2> has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and CVE-2013-6282 in their attacks.

[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to spy on individuals in the <e2>Caucasus</e2> regions and individuals interested in the <e1>Ahrar al-Sham</e1> militant group in Syria. [SEP]
[CLS] ) Upload and purge collected evidence Destroy device by resetting locking password Execute shell commands Send SMS with defined content or location Disable network Disable root Uninstall bot To avoid detection and removal of the agent app in the device memory, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> suite also detects emulators or sandboxes, obfuscates code using DexGuard, uses ELF string obfuscator, and adjusts the OOM (out-of-memory) value. Interestingly, one unused feature of the app is its ability to manipulate data in the Android package manager to add and remove permissions and components as well as hide the app icon. Recommendations Popular mobile platforms like Android are common targets for organized or commercialized monitoring operations. Attackers know that rooting devices via malware exploits is an effective means to control devices and gather information from them. In a root broken device, security is a fairy tale. Take note of the following best practices to prevent this threat from getting in your device: Disable app installations from unknown, third-party sources. Constantly update your Android devices to the latest version to help prevent exploits, especially in the case of RCSAndroid which can affect only up to version 4.4.4 KitKat. Note, however, that based on the leak mail from a customer inquiry, Hacking Team was in the process of developing exploits for Android 5.0 Lollipop. Install a mobile security solution to secure your device from threats. The leaked RCSAndroid code is a commercial weapon now in the wild. Mobile users are called on to be on top of this news and be on guard for signs of monitoring. Some indicators may come in the form of peculiar behavior such as unexpected rebooting, finding unfamiliar apps installed, or instant messaging apps suddenly freezing. Should a device become infected, this backdoor cannot be removed without root privilege. Users may be required the help of their device manufacturer to get support for firmware flashing. <e2>Trend Micro</e2> offers security for Android mobile devices through Mobile Security for Android™ to protect against these types of attacks.

[CLS] FakeSpy Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the <e1>Roaming Mantis</e1> threat group infect Android users with the FakeSpy infostealer. Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, <e2>Taiwan</e2>, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. [SEP]
[CLS] Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only <e2>Korean</e2> and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. Japan Post - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. Yamato Transport - One of Japan's largest door-to-door delivery service companies, also in Tokyo. <e1>Chunghwa Post</e1> - The government-owned corporation Chunghwa is the official postal service of Taiwan.

[CLS] The Chinese cybercriminals behind <e1>HummingBad</e1> made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year. The initial warnings about Ghost Push landed in September last year, and Google said in April it was the most successful Android malware of 2015, infecting around 4 million phones in its various forms. It also rooted devices and displayed malicious ads. In October, security firm Cheetah Mobile Security said thredifferent versions of Ghost Push were propagating at a rate of 10,000 installs a day. The Gooligan hackers' escapades date back to at least June 2015, however, when the first evidence of the malware code was found. Check Point saw Android phones infected with malicious software containing early Gooligan code when physically connected to PCs running a <e2>Windows</e2> back-up tool, SnapPea. [SEP]
[CLS] Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “<e2>Android</e2> BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks <e1>MysteryBot</e1> (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] It was removed after Lookout notified <e1>Google</e1> on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party. Palestine is a lightning rod of political controversy both around the world and domestically, as the territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have played host to an ongoing and deadly clash between <e2>Hamas</e2> and Fatah. [SEP]
[CLS] mobeebom has been promoting the MobiHok RAT through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since <e2>January 2019</e2>. MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In July 2016, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like OmniRat and <e1>DroidJack</e1>, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum. [SEP]
[CLS] “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the <e2>Central Asian</e2> nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.” In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to <e1>Special Technology Center (STC)</e1>, a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U. [SEP]
[CLS] In order to ensure maximum protection for Internet users in the country, the <e1>ngCERT</e1> has offered a number of preventive measures to be taken by the consumers. These measures include an advisory to telecom consumers and other Internet users to refrain from opening Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) from unknown sources while using your mobile devices. Additionally, telecom consumers should never respond or send reply to messages or call back a phone number that is associated with the text that they are unaware of. Should any telecom consumer or Internet user become curious and wish to ascertain the authenticity of any call or messages and wish to probe the incident, such persons may do a web search of both the number and the message content. The <e2>NCC</e2> hereby reiterates that mobile users are under obligation to practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact. [SEP]
[CLS] The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called <e1>APT-C-23</e1> targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families. What it does The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The chat application acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app. At the time of writing Lookout has observed two updates to the <e2>Dardesh</e2> application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28.

[CLS] <e1>TangleBot</e1> Malware Reaches Deep into Android Device Functions The mobile baddie grants itself access to almost everything, enabling spying, data-harvesting, stalking and fraud attacks, among others. An Android malware called TangleBot has weaved its way onto the cyber-scene: One that researchers said can perform a bouquet of malicious actions, including stealing personal info and controlling apps and device functions. According to Cloudmark researchers, the newly discovered mobile malware is spreading via SMS messaging in the U.S. and Canada, using lures about COVID-19 boosters and regulations. The goal is to social-engineer targets into clicking on an embedded link, which takes them to a website. The site tells users they need an “Adobe Flash update.” If they click on the subsequent dialog boxes, TangleBot malware installs. In propagation and theme, TangleBot resembles other mobile malware, such as the FluBot SMS malware that targets the U.K. and <e2>Europe</e2> or the CovidLock Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients. [SEP]
[CLS] New XLoader Variant Masquerades as Android Security Apps, iOS Configuration Profile A new variant of XLoader is masquerading as Android security apps and an iOS configuration profile to target mobile users. <e2>Trend Micro</e2> detected the variant while analyzing a smishing campaign that tricked mobile users into visiting one of several fake websites, including a clone of a Japanese mobile phone operator. Whenever an Android user visited a malicious site and/or pressed any of the available buttons, the campaign triggered the download of an Android Package (APK) for fake security software (assuming the user has enabled the installation of third-party apps in their Unknown Sources settings). This APK contained the variant of XLoader, a family of malware that is capable of behaving as spyware and a banking Trojan. In the event an iOS user visited one of the malicious websites, the campaign redirected to another website that prompted them to download a malicious iOS configuration profile. The campaign claimed this profile would help the user’s device resolve a network issue that’s preventing the site from loading. If the user downloaded the profile, the site loads and reveals an Apple phishing page. The Growth of <e1>XLoader</e1> Trend Micro first observed efforts to distribute XLoader disguised as legitimate Facebook and Chrome apps in April 2018. [SEP]
[CLS] R.L. to <e1>eSurv S.R.L.</e1> on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. <e2>iOS</e2> development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port.

[CLS] apk” and all use the domain <e1>“XXXX.ru”,</e1> which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider).” “The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.) The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims.” How the attack occurs? The victims are attracted to download the malicious code of the malware through SMS phishing campaign in which a short SMS message is sent to the victims. This message contains the infected URL link. Unsuspecting users immediately click on the harmless looking link. As soon as they do so, <e2>RuMMs</e2> infects their devices immediately. [SEP]
[CLS] The so-called <e1>ViperRAT</e1> malware was incorporated into two apps, and it has previously targeted members of the Israeli Defense Force. Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker "a considerable amount of control over a compromised device." The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party <e2>Fatah</e2>. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. [SEP]
[CLS] During the past three years, security researchers from Citizen Lab, a laboratory at the <e1>Munk School of Global Affairs</e1> at the University of Toronto, <e2>Canada</e2>, have been tracking cases where Pegasus has been deployed in the wild. [SEP]
[CLS] Cerberus and <e1>Alien</e1>: the malware that has put Android in a tight spot The most complex Android malware in recent years has released its source code and malicious actors have their own forks, strongly motivated by financial gain. Is 2020 the year of smartphone malware? 2020 is the year of the rat, and we actually aren’t talking about the Chinese horoscope. According to several cybersecurity researchers, 2020 has seen an explosive increase in <e2>Remote access Trojan</e2>s, or “RATs”. [SEP]
[CLS] For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The <e1>HackingTeam</e1>’s <e2>RCS</e2> delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection. [SEP]
[CLS] Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their <e2>Gmail</e2>, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. <e1>Ghost Push</e1> Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year.

[CLS] The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871) vulnerabilities in the <e1>default browsers</e1> of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing another local privilege escalation exploit to execute. When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a <e2>local privilege escalation vulnerability</e2> in Android devices. [SEP]
[CLS] The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, <e2>France</e2>, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, <e1>Choopa</e1>, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called <e2>NSO Group</e2> that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. "We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits," the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. "The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes," the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in United Arab Emirates jails. Mansoor was almost immediately suspicious, he said. He has been jailed for his activism and targeted with commercial malware in past incidents that researchers have linked to the UAE government. “I’m a regular target for the authorities here,” he told The Post. “Every time they get new spyware, they seem to try it out on me.” So instead of clicking the links in the text messages, he sent them to researchers at Citizen Lab. Working with Lookout, they confirmed his fears: Mansoor’s attackers would have been able to essentially take over his phone if he'd clicked. The UAE did not immediately respond to a <e1>Post</e1> request for comment. [SEP]
[CLS] In this way, login credentials are stolen and passed to a remote server under the control of the hackers. <e1>Red Alert 2.0,</e1> which has been offered for sale on Russian-speaking hacking forums, is also capable of waltzing past two-factor authentication systems by intercepting SMS text messages that the smartphone receives and passing them onto hackers. Furthermore, according to researchers, Red Alert 2.0 continues to be updated with functionality recently added to block incoming calls from banks, including those which may be from financial fraud departments investigating potential malicious activity. In short, your Android phone gets infected by Red Alert 2.0 banking malware, hackers start to plunder your account to make unauthorised purchases or money transfers, and your bank can’t get hold of you if they suspect something suspicious is occurring. Red Alert 2.0 is said to work on phones running Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) and earlier. As always, you would be wise to be cautious of what apps you install on your Android device – particularly if they are sourced from unofficial app marketplaces. Whether they are breaking into social media profiles to post spam or raiding <e2>online bank accounts</e2> to steal money, criminals are dead-set on exploiting innocent people’s mobile devices to make money. [SEP]
[CLS] For example, the Ztorg Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play almost 100 times since September 2016. But <e1>Dvmap</e1> is very special rooting malware. It uses a variety of new techniques, but the most interesting thing is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries – libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so. This makes Dvmap the first Android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime, and it has been downloaded from the Google Play Store more than 50,000 times. Kaspersky Lab reported the Trojan to <e2>Google</e2>, and it has now been removed from the store. [SEP]
[CLS] Zero-Click Apple Zero-Day Uncovered in <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spy Attack The phones of 36 journalists were infected by four APTs, possibly linked to Saudi Arabia or the UAE. Four nation-state-backed advanced persistent threats (APTs) hacked Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors and executives, in an espionage attack leveraging a zero-day exploit for Apple iPhone, researchers said. The attack, carried out in July and August, compromised 36 personal phones belonging to the victims, according to Citizen Lab. The firm said that the perpetrators could belong to up to four APTs, including potentially those linked to Saudi Arabia and the <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2>. All of the operators used the NSO Group’s infamous Pegasus spyware as their final payload. [SEP]
[CLS] During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “<e1>Conversations</e1>.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app. The modified Conversations app mimics Telegram messenger, but experts did not find any malicious activity implemented by this specific app. “Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the <e2>Conversations app</e2>, used to infect victims, we didn’t discover anything malicious in it,” continues Kaspersky.

[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to spy on individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the <e2>Ahrar al-Sham</e2> militant group in Syria. Recent samples of Monokle include the Xposed framework that allows Android users to apply modules to an Android device’s ROM(Read Only Memory). Some Monokle fake apps include Xposed modules that implement functionality for hooking and hiding presence in the process list Much of the core malicious functionality implemented in the later samples of Monokle use an XOR obfuscated DEX file in the assets folder. “The functionality hidden in this DEX file includes all cryptographic functions implemented in the open source library spongycastle11, various e-mail protocols, extraction and exfiltration of all data, serialisation and deserialisation of data using the Thrift protocol, and rooting and hooking functionality, among others ” continues the report. As anticipated, Monokle was developed by STC, the experts noticed that Monokle and the STC’s Android security suite called Defender are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure. “Command and control infrastructure that communicates with the Defender application also communicates with Monokle samples. The signing certificates used for signing Android application packages overlap between Defender and Monokle as well.” continues the report. “Additional overlap was observed by <e1>Lookout</e1> researchers between Monokle and the defensive security software produced by STC in the authors’ development and implementation choices.

[CLS] According to BleepingComputer, the <e2>fake Orange app</e2> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust, and Wells Fargo. Who Is Responsible? Because they were cautious enough to conceal their C2 infrastructure registration trace, there is no clear information on the cybercriminals who are now delivering the Anubis malware.

[CLS] <e1>Gooligan</e1> Android malware grabs a million Google accounts in huge Google Play fraud Dysfunctional Android patching comes back to bite Google via two million fraudulent installs from Google Play in three months. A million Google accounts have been compromised in a massive fraud campaign exploiting Android devices and Google Play. At the heart of the campaign is a new variant of Android malware dubbed Gooligan, concealed in dozens of Android apps that exploit two unpatched flaws in Android to root infected devices. The malware nabs email account information and authentication tokens for accessing Google accounts. The attackers use the tokens to install select apps from Google Play on an infected device to boost in-app advertising revenue. Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Researchers have warned that over half of Android devices are still susceptible to Ghost Push malware.

[CLS] Some applications attempted to masquerade as legitimate ones like <e2>Telegram</e2>, others were COVID-19 contact tracing apps or benign tools like a fake digital thermometer, and others impersonated Android built-in tools. The common factor was that all of them had an additional functionality: allowing the adversary to spy on the users who installed them. In this article we will examine the internal workings of one of those applications to analyze its capabilities and understand how it is used by the threat actors. What is a remote access trojan (RAT)? A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that controls a system through a remote network connection. A RAT is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a trojan horse program, and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software and other anti-virus software. A RAT enables its operators to perform many activities on the compromised device (e.g. control a device's camera, access its storage, intercept calls and text messages, etc.). This is all done via an easy-to-use application hosted on a command and control server. Executive summary A sample Android application was chosen for analysis from a pool of 71 malicious ones reported by Lookout’s research. The sample examined is an instance of the <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1>. After the application is installed, it is displayed as Android with the icon resembling the one of the built-in Android applications Settings. [SEP]

[CLS] Report: NSO Group's Pegasus Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the <e1>Financial Times</e1> on Friday. According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. <e2>Facebook</e2> said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.

[CLS] The malware, <e1>Android/SpyC32.A</e1>, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in 2017 by several security research teams. Meanwhile, the updated version, Android/SpyC23.A, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don’t know how this fake <e2>WeMessage</e2> app was distributed. [SEP]
[CLS] Timeline of posts related to the <e1>Hacking Team</e1> DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their Remote Control System (RCS) agent installed in their targets’ systems. July 14 A new zero-day vulnerability (<e2>CVE-2015-2425</e2>) was found in Internet Explorer. [SEP]
[CLS] Dropbox, Facebook, Google, <e1>Microsoft</e1>, Twitter and Yahoo are among the companies whose apps and services use end-to-end encryption. This kind of encryption is good for protecting your privacy, but governments don’t like it because it makes it difficult for them to spy on people, whether tracking criminals and terrorists or, as some governments have been known to do, snooping on dissidents, protesters and journalists. Enter an Israeli technology firm, NSO Group. The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone. Pegasus is designed to infiltrate devices running Android, Blackberry, iOS and Symbian operating systems and turn them into surveillance devices. The company says it sells Pegasus only to governments and only for the purposes of tracking criminals and terrorists. How it works Earlier version of Pegasus were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities in commonly used apps or by spear-phishing, which involves tricking a targeted user into clicking a link or opening a document that secretly installs the software. It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or manually if an agent can steal the target’s phone. Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone’s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/<e2>Flickr</e2>, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss.

[CLS] During <e2>March 2019</e2>, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot <e1>Gustuff</e1> DiseaseBot Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

[CLS] We found that among the leaked files is the code for Hacking Team’s open-source malware suite RCSAndroid (<e1>Remote Control System Android</e1>), which was sold by the company as a tool for monitoring targets. (Researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014.) The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations. Based on the leaked code, the RCSAndroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including <e2>Skype</e2>, Facebook, Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

[CLS] However, although the “<e2>Concipit1248</e2>” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

Apple on Thursday issued security updates for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Safari to address a vulnerability that potentially allows nefarious agents to take over a target device with a single click. Dubbed "Pegasus," the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in <e2>Safari WebKit</e2>.

[CLS] DualToy: New Windows Trojan Sideloads Risky Apps to Android and iOS Devices Over the past two years, we’ve observed many cases of Microsoft <e2>Windows</e2> and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices. This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors as almost everyone on the planet carries at least one mobile device they interact with throughout any given day. Thanks to a relative lack of security controls applied to mobile devices, these devices have become very attractive targets for a broad range of malicious actors. For example: <e1>WireLurker</e1> installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection.

[CLS] The Android app, called "TrickMo" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted <e2>German</e2> users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware. "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," IBM researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious Ryuk ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials. Abusing Android's Accessibility Features to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the <e1>CERT-Bund</e1> last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices.

ERMAC differs from Cerberus in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm. “Despite the usage of different obfuscation techniques and new method of string encryption – using Blowfish encryption algorithm, we can definitely state that ERMAC is another Cerberus-based trojan.” reads the analysis published by Threatfabric. “Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts. clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device At the time of writing, ThreatFabric researchers with the help of support @malwrhunterteam experts determine that ERMAC is only targeting Poland, where is being distributed under the guise of delivery service and government applications. The new banking trojan can target over three hundred banking and mobile apps. “The story of ERMAC shows one more time how malware source code leaks can lead not only to slow evaporation of the malware family but also bring new threats/actors to the threat landscape. Being built on Cerberus basement, ERMAC introduces couple of new features.

[CLS] XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and <e1>FakeSpy</e1> have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices. This variant is distributed via smishing. XLoader version 6.0 abuses Twitter profiles to hide its C&C server. The malware author has made some changes to this XLoader version in line with its new deployment method. XLoader version 7.0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘XLoader version 7.0’ that poses as a pornography app for Android devices. This variant abuses Instagram and Tumblr profiles to hide its C&C server. XLoader version 7.0 targets <e2>South Korean</e2> Android users. [SEP]

[CLS] Most likely, the malware was spread via other means like a spearphishing attachment or a link. A <e1>SpyNote</e1> client can masquerade as legitimate application. Static code analysis indicates that the malware, after successful installation, would install a legitimate application embedded in the APK file at res/raw/google.apk. Also, screenshots of cracked SpyNote server v6.4.4 proves that functionality: The adversary can pick a name of the application, service, its version, and the name of a victim to be able to differentiate them. This value can be extracted from the res/values/strings.xml file. In this particular example they were set as follows: Android applications, including malware, can listen for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast event to ensure the application will be activated upon device start up, and this is the technique that SpyNote utilizes to achieve its persistence mechanism. As per the AndroidManifest.xml file, the class that is receiving the BOOT_COMPLETED event is com.android.tester.C4: This class waits for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, checks if the com.android.tester.C11 service is already running, and, if not, initiates it. The service is responsible for processing commands received from the C2 server and is also the class where most of the code resides. SpyNote is able to discover installed applications, so that the attackers can tell which security appliances are deployed to a device. A reason for collection of the list of applications may be to discover high value applications like banking or <e2>messaging software</e2>.

The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes.

[CLS] In addition, <e2>Monokle</e2> has the ability to install trusted certificates which allow it to gain root access to the device. This allows the attackers to deploy unique capabilities in their quest to steal data. Much of this is achieved by exploiting accessibility services and tailoring them to steal data from third-party applications, as well as using the predictive-text dictionaries of the user to gain insight into the kinds of topic that interest them. The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode. "Monokle is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software," Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told ZDNet. "It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device." While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to <e1>Special Technology Centre</e1> (STC), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. [SEP]
[CLS] Disguises used by <e2>Anubis</e2> where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] The list has been attributed to <e1>NSO Group</e1>, but the list’s origins are unclear. A statement from Amnesty International in Israel stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients, though it’s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. A media consortium, the Pegasus Project, analyzed the phone numbers on the list and identified over 1,000 people in over 50 countries. The findings included people who appear to fall outside of the NSO Group’s restriction to investigations of criminal and terrorist activity. These include politicians, government workers, journalists, human rights activists, business executives and Arab royal family members. Other ways your phone can be tracked Pegasus is breathtaking in its stealth and its seeming ability to take complete control of someone’s phone, but it’s not the only way people can be spied on through their phones. Some of the ways phones can aid surveillance and undermine privacy include location tracking, eavesdropping, malware and collecting data from sensors. An electronic device with handles on either side of a front panel containing buttons and lights and a graphic representation of a stingray Law enforcement agencies use cell site simulators like this StingRay to intercept calls from phones in the vicinity of the device. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office via AP Governments and phone companies can track a phone’s location by tracking cell signals from cell tower transceivers and cell transceiver simulators like the StingRay device. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals can also be used to track phones. In some cases, apps and web browsers can determine a phone’s location. Eavesdropping on communications is harder to accomplish than tracking, but it is possible in situations in which encryption is weak or lacking. Some types of malware can compromise privacy by accessing data. The <e2>National Security Agency</e2> has sought agreements with technology companies under which the companies would give the agency special access into their products via backdoors, and has reportedly built backdoors on its own.

[CLS] According to <e2>BleepingComputer</e2>, the latest version of Anubis targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a keylogger login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device. The newest Anubis acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the <e1>fake Orange app</e1> is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. [SEP]
[CLS] During the investigation, <e2>Kaspersky</e2> also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “Conversations.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app. The modified Conversations app mimics Telegram messenger, but experts did not find any malicious activity implemented by this specific app. “Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn’t discover anything malicious in it,” continues Kaspersky. “This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind ViceLeaker for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.” Experts were aware of the possibility that threat actors might be using a compromised email account, investigating it they found a personal page and a <e1>GitHub</e1> account that contains a forked Conversation repository.

[CLS] Timeline of posts related to the <e1>Hacking Team</e1> DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their Remote Control System (RCS) agent installed in their targets’ systems. July 14 A new zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-2425) was found in Internet Explorer. July 16 On the mobile front, a fake news app designed to bypass Google Play was discovered. July 20 A new zero-day vulnerability (<e2>CVE-2015-2426</e2>) was found in Windows, which Microsoft fixed in an out-of-band patch. [SEP]
[CLS] The Android app, called “TrickMo” by <e2>IBM X-Force</e2> researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German (in September 2019) users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware.

[CLS] This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of <e1>Android/Twitoor.A,</e1> can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one. “Using Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” says <e2>Lukáš Štefanko</e2>, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. [SEP]
[CLS] Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff <e1>DiseaseBot</e1> Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape. The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, <e2>Asia</e2> and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

[CLS] Our findings, along with previous research, indicates that the threat actor behind these recent campaigns is likely a Chinese group dubbed “<e1>Roaming Mantis</e1>”. Roaming Mantis is believed to be a Chinese threat actor group first discovered in April 2018 that has continuously evolved. In the beginning, this threat group mainly targeted Asian countries. Now, they are expanding their activity to audiences all around the world. As part of their activities, they are known for hijacking DNS settings on Japanese routers that redirect users to malicious IP addresses, creating disguised malicious Android apps that appear as popular apps, stealing Apple ID credentials by creating Apple phishing pages, as well as performing web crypto mining on browsers. CONNECTION TO CHINA Chinese server infrastructure: FakeSpy applications send stolen information to C2 domains with .club TLDs and URLs ending with /servlet/[C2 Command] (mentioned above in the “Stealing Sensitive Information” section). All of these domains are registered to ‘Li Jun Biao’ on Bizcn, Inc, a Chinese Internet application service provider. Chinese language traces in the code: During the investigation, the Cybereason Nocturnus team discovered code artifacts that may indicate Chinese threat actors. For example, we found several suspicious strings written in the Chinese language in a function called isNetworkAvailable, previously discussed in this blog: An almost identical function is mentioned in an earlier research, that ties FakeSpy and other malware to the Roaming Mantis group. Chinese APK names: Some of FakeSpy’s APK package names contain anglicized Chinese (Mandarin) words that might be related to Chinese songs and lyrics, food, provinces, etc. CONCLUSIONS FakeSpy was first seen in October 2017 and until recently mainly targeted East Asian countries. Our research shows fresh developments in the malware’s code and sophistication, as well as an expansion to target Europe and North America. This mobile malware masquerades as legitimate, trusted postal <e2>service applications</e2> so that it can gain the users trust. [SEP]

It will also connect with its C2 server, download more Android apps and install them in background through “pm install” command. Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example, for a 64-bit Windows PC, “AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi” and “AppleApplicationSupport64.msi” will be downloaded. These two installers are part of Apple’s official iTunes for <e2>Windows</e2> software that contains all necessary driver files that iTunes uses to interact with iOS devices. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Pegasus</e1> For Android: The Other Side Of The Story Emerges Today, Lookout and Google are releasing research into the Android version of one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we’ve seen in the wild: Pegasus. A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets. Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout <e2>Security Cloud</e2>, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. [SEP]

[CLS] Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group APT-C-23, also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram. The malware, Android/SpyC32.A, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in <e2>2017</e2> by several security research teams.

[CLS] New Android Malware RuMMS Targeting Users through Smishing FireEye security firms’ researchers have identified a new Android family malware that is currently targeting <e2>Russian</e2> users. The malware is distributed via a series of infected subdomains that are actually registered with an authentic domain name, which is owned by a popular shared hosting service provider based in Russia. The malware has been dubbed as RuMMS because the URLs used in this particular scheme are all in the same format: hxxp://yyyyyyyyXXXX.ru/mms.apk Here XXX.ru represents the domain name. FireEye experts noted: “So far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread RuMMS in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file “mms.apk” and all use the domain “XXXX.ru”, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider).” “The threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.) The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims.” How the attack occurs? The victims are attracted to download the malicious code of the malware through SMS phishing campaign in which a short SMS message is sent to the victims. This message contains the infected URL link. Unsuspecting users immediately click on the harmless looking link. As soon as they do so, <e1>RuMMs</e1> infects their devices immediately. [SEP]
[CLS] The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named <e1>FrozenCell</e1> - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted <e2>Google Drive</e2> links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27.

[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called <e1>Ahrar Maps</e1> made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham. “There is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,” according to the report. “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.” In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to Special Technology Center (STC), a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the <e2>U.S.</e2> government under President Obama, for interfering in the 2016 presidential elections.

[CLS] To make the <e1>Twitoor</e1> botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it’s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,” explains Štefanko. In the Windows space, Twitter, founded in <e2>2006</e2>, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. [SEP]
[CLS] NSO Group has denied its involvement in that case. <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of Pegasus’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime messages or notifications. Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based <e1>Al Araby TV</e1>. “Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,” according to Citizen Lab.

[CLS] One module is used to exfiltrate <e2>Skype</e2> call recordings, but other capabilities include keylogging, turning on the mic to record audio, capturing screenshots and exfiltrating data. Skygofree wasn’t created from scratch as Kaspersky noted “it looks like the attackers created this exploit payload based on android-rooting-tools project source code.” In another instance, the researchers “found some code similarities between the implant for Windows and other public accessible projects. It appears the developers have copied the functional part of the keylogger module from this project.” How victims are infected This spyware is being used for targeted surveillance; all known targets have been located in Italy. Victims are infected after being lured to visit specific malicious sites meant to look like those of mobile operators. Once there, the target is infected with “sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device.” Just because surveillance features haven’t been seen before doesn’t mean the Android spyware is new. In fact, Kaspersky believes the malware was created at least by the end of 2014. Kaspersky discovered it in October 2017 and noted that one of the domains used to spread the spyware was registered by the attackers that same month. However, the domains hosting fake mobile operator sites were registered in 2015; that is the year Kaspersky said the distribution campaign was “most active” – it is also the year the Hacking Team was hacked. Italian company behind Skygofree Kaspersky didn’t go so far as to say which company is behind Skygofree, it is “pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like <e1>HackingTeam</e1>.” Various artifacts in the code referenced “negg;” Forbes’ sources claimed the Rome-based Negg is “working with the police now” to fill “the gap left behind by Hacking Team.

[CLS] <e1>DualToy</e1> Windows Trojan Attacks Android, iOS Devices Researchers have found a malware family called DualToy that infects Windows PCs and sideloads malware onto connected Android and iOS devices. A Windows Trojan called DualToy has been discovered that can side load malicious apps onto Android and iOS devices via a USB connection from an infected computer. Researchers from Palo Alto Networks said DualToy has been in existence since January 2015, and it originally was limited to installing unwanted apps and displaying mobile ads on Android devices. About six months later, the Trojan morphed and began targeting iOS devices by installing a third-party App Store in hopes of nabbing iTunes usernames and passwords. “When DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android devices… We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015. Later in 2016, a new variant appeared,” wrote senior malware researcher Claud Xiao in a technical description of the Trojan. Researchers said once DualToy infects a Windows machine, it looks for the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes, and downloads drivers for both if they’re missing in order to infect mobile devices once connected. “Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms,” <e2>Xiao</e2> wrote.

[CLS] cybersecurity firms <e1>Palo Alto Networks</e1> and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified <e2>Google</e2> on April 3. [SEP]
[CLS] Security researchers have discovered the iOS counterpart of a dangerous Android spyware strain that was seen earlier this year on the official <e2>Google Play Store</e2>. The good news, according to security researchers from cyber-security firm Lookout, is that the iOS version is less sophisticated than the Android variant and has not yet been distributed via the official Apple App Store. <e1>EXODUS</e1> ANDROID VARIANT DISCOVERED LAST MONTH The spyware is named Exodus and was developed by Italian app maker Connexxa, a known provider of surveillance tools to Italian authorities. [SEP]
[CLS] The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, <e2>Almisshal</e2>’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call <e1>Sneaky Kestral</e1> spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted.

[CLS] Ginp has primarily targeted <e1>Spanish banks</e1>, but recent evidence suggests the malware has changed or may change its targeting strategy in the near future to focus on Turkey. The following chart shows infection rates for different Android malware families from the last 90 days and demonstrates that Ginp accounts for nearly 12% of infections during this time. Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that Ginp malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of <e2>Turkish banks</e2>, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in Poland and the United Kingdom.

[CLS] Millions of <e2>Google</e2> accounts breached by new Android malware Gooligan affects users of Android 4 and 5 and can be used to steal Google account credentials. Millions of Google accounts have been compromised in a new attack campaign that uses Android credentials to access data from Google services. The Gooligan malware is downloaded to smartphone devices through third-party app stores, security firm Check Point found. The apps could also be downloaded if the user clicks on a malicious link in a phishing message. AndroidFrom there, it proceeds to download a rootkit which exploits vulnerabilities in the user’s device to take it over. It then downloads a malicious module from a command and control (C&C) server which allows Gooligan to steal credentials for email and other services. In addition, the control can be used to install apps from Google Play and rate them using the user’s Google account or install adware on the user’s device to generate revenue. Devices that can be affected by the malware include Android 4 and Android 5, which Check Point says includes 74 percent of devices currently in use. Check Point is currently working with Google Security to find the source of the attack. Google said that it was taking steps to secure victims’ accounts, such as notifying those affected, revoking affected tokens and deploying SafetyNet improvements. GooliganAccording to Google, there is no evidence that user data has been accessed, and the credentials have been used primarily to promote apps. Google said that the malware was part of a family called <e1>Ghost Push</e1> all targeted at doing the same thing. [SEP]
[CLS] The list of these original features is very limited compared to recent banking Trojans but enough to steal personal information from the victims: Overlaying: Dynamic - C2 based (possibility to remotely modify the list of targeted application) SMS blocking (hiding messages from the victim) SMS sending (capability to send messages from the infected device) SMS harvesting (possibility to send a copy of all message to the C2 server) About <e1>Anubis</e1> Rise of maza-in By publishing the aforementioned article, maza-in earned himself a reputation of Android expert on underground forums. He started to share tips and tricks to help other threat actors deal with technical issues and enhance their own malware. Shortly after the initial article, the actor even conducted an interview with Forbes magazine named “I Want To Expose <e2>Google</e2>’s Mistakes”, stating that he published the malicious code to improve the state of Android security, by showing design flaws in the system that can be easily abused. [SEP]
[CLS] The Dardesh app was spotted and analyzed by <e2>Lookout</e2> researchers, who dubbed the malware family Desert Scorpion. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. “The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,” the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed APT-C-23 to be behind this scheme. “Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers,” they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-23. Also, the C&C infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families.

[CLS] Royal Mail, DHL Group, France's Las Poste, Taiwan's Chunghwa Post, several private delivery companies in Japan as well as others in Switzerland and Germany, <e1>Cybereason</e1> researchers say. If the recipient clicks on the links in these messages, malicious code is downloaded onto the Android device that installs the FakeSpy malware. The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday. FakeSpy has been active in the wild since at least 2017. Its operators have been refining the information stealer’s code over the last three years and adding capabilities, according to Cybereason. The latest version has a larger target list that includes the U.S. and <e2>Europe</e2>. "The threat actors are preying on unsuspecting victims because people tend to open emails and messages when it comes to their deliveries," Assaf Dahan, senior director and head of threat research at Cybereason, tells Information Security Media Group.

[CLS] One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted <e2>Aug. 10 and 11</e2>, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. [SEP]
[CLS] Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, <e1>Twitter</e1> and Yahoo are among the companies whose apps and services use end-to-end encryption. This kind of encryption is good for protecting your privacy, but governments don’t like it because it makes it difficult for them to spy on people, whether tracking criminals and terrorists or, as some governments have been known to do, snooping on dissidents, protesters and journalists. Enter an Israeli technology firm, NSO Group. The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone. Pegasus is designed to infiltrate devices running Android, Blackberry, iOS and Symbian operating systems and turn them into surveillance devices. The company says it sells Pegasus only to governments and only for the purposes of tracking criminals and terrorists. How it works Earlier version of Pegasus were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities in commonly used apps or by spear-phishing, which involves tricking a targeted user into clicking a link or opening a document that secretly installs the software. It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or manually if an agent can steal the target’s phone. Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone’s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/<e2>Flickr</e2>, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss.

[CLS] Malicious Pokémon GO App Spreading <e1>DroidJack</e1> RAT An infected Android version of the Pokémon GO app is infecting unsuspecting users with the malicious remote access tool DroidJack. First released in the United States on July 6, Pokémon GO is a mobile game available for Android and iPhone. It leverages Niantic’s Real World Gaming Platform to help players find and catch Pokémon as they explore real world locations. In response to growing interest around the game, various online forums published tutorials demonstrating how Android users could download an APK for the game from a non-Google URL. Doing so involved modifying Android’s security settings so that users could install APKs from “untrusted sources.” Researchers at Proofpoint explain that’s a poor security decision for Android users to make: “Unfortunately, this is an extremely risky practice and can easily lead users to installing malicious apps on their own mobile devices.. Should an individual download an APK from a third party that has been infected with a backdoor,… their device would then be compromised.” Case in point, at least one of those unofficial APKs comes modified with DroidJack, a remote access tool which like other mobile <e2>trojans</e2> gives an attacker full control over an infected device.

[CLS] The HackingTeam’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said.

[CLS] “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s <e1>Pegasus</e1> spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, France, <e2>U.K.</e2>, and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware, known as Pegasus (or Trident), was created by Israeli cyber-security firm <e1>NSO Group</e1> and has been around for at least three years --when it was first detailed in a report over the summer of 2016. The malware can operate on both Android and iOS devices, albeit it's been mostly spotted in campaigns targeting iPhone users primarily. On infected devices, Pegasus is a powerful spyware that can do many things, such as record conversations, steal private messages, exfiltrate photos, and much much more. During the past three years, security researchers from Citizen Lab, a laboratory at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada, have been tracking cases where Pegasus has been deployed in the wild. In many instances, the spyware was used by oppressive government regimes to spy on journalists, human rights defenders, opposition politicians, lawyers, and anti-corruption advocates. But new data published today by <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the Pegasus spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place.

FakeSpy first targeted South Korean and <e2>Japanese</e2> speakers. [SEP]
[CLS] We named this specific Android Trojan “<e2>RootAngel</e2>”. After the service is started by guardmb, and install the SU daemon. It will also connect with its C2 server, download more Android apps and install them in background through “pm install” command. Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example, for a 64-bit Windows PC, “AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi” and “AppleApplicationSupport64.msi” will be downloaded. These two installers are part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software that contains all necessary driver files that iTunes uses to interact with iOS devices. After that, DualToy will execute <e1>“msiexec.exe”</e1> to install the installers shown in Figure 8 in background via the “/qn” parameter. [SEP]
[CLS] ” Newer features coming to <e1>Anubis</e1> banking trojan The Anubis banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as <e2>Revolut</e2> and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.

[CLS] Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named <e1>Connexxa S.R.L.</e1> and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated <e2>Italian</e2> and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. [SEP]
[CLS] However, it has begun to target users all around the world, especially users in countries like China, <e2>Taiwan</e2>, France, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, and others. FakeSpy masquerades as legitimate postal service apps and transportation services in order to gain the users' trust. Once installed, the application requests permissions so that it may control SMS messages and steal sensitive data on the device, as well as proliferate to other devices in the target device’s contact list. Cybereason's investigation shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy campaign is a Chinese-speaking group dubbed "Roaming Mantis", a group that has led similar campaigns. FakeSpy has been in the wild since 2017; this latest campaign indicates that it has become more powerful. Code improvements, new capabilities, anti-emulation techniques, and new, global targets all suggest that this malware is well-maintained by its authors and continues to evolve. INTRODUCTION For the past several weeks, <e1>Cybereason</e1> has been investigating a new version of Android malware dubbed FakeSpy, which was first identified in October 2017 and reported again in October 2018.

[CLS] Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen <e1>Pegasus</e1> can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone’s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/Flickr, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user’s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything. All that is required for a successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or operating system installed on the device. This is known as a zero-click exploit. Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts. It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance without the permission or knowledge of the user. Who has been using Pegasus and why NSO Group says it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the Mexican government in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist <e2>Jamal Khashoggi</e2>. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. [SEP]
[CLS] Yes, this time researchers have found a source code to a new piece of weaponized android malware that had the capability to infect millions of Android devices even when users are running latest versions of the android mobile operating system. <e1>Trend Micro</e1> researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling RCSAndroid (Remote Control System Android), which they says, is one of the "most professionally developed and sophisticated" pieces of Android malware a.k.a Android hacking tool they have ever seen. RCSAndroid is a sophisticated, real-world surveillance and hacking tool that provides even unskilled hackers to deploy one of the world's more advanced surveillance suites for Google's mobile operating system Android. List of Creepy Features of Android Hacking Tool Once installed on targets' devices, RCSAndroid would have helped government and law enforcement agencies around the world to completely compromise and monitor Android devices remotely. Here are some of the features of RCSAndroid include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger. RCSAndroid Android hacking tool had been in the wild since 2012 and has been known to Citizen Lab researchers since last year when the security firm detailed a Hacking Team backdoor used against Android users in <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2>.

[CLS] Logs collected by <e2>Check Point</e2> researchers show that every day Gooligan installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages. After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign’s Command and Control (C&C) server. Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware <e1>HummingBad</e1>. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user’s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install adware to generate revenue Ad servers, which don’t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play. [SEP]
[CLS] At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, <e1>MonkeyTest</e1>, and Xinyinhe. By late 2015, the malware’s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes. The change in the way the malware works today may be to help finance the campaign through fraudulent ad activity. The malware simulates clicks on app advertisements provided by legitimate ad networks and forces the app to install on a device. An attacker is paid by the network when one of these apps is installed successfully. Logs collected by Check Point researchers show that every day Gooligan installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages.

[CLS] And as the recent leak of <e1>National Security Agency</e1> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. Governments and companies such as the NSO Group that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there’s no guarantee others won’t discover the same problems, some say. “Government use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,” said Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. “It's not like terrorists are using different phones from the rest of us.” Apple devices have long had a reputation for security, according to Forrester Research principal analyst Jeff Pollard — one highlighted earlier this year when the company faced down the <e2>FBI</e2> in a legal battle over an encrypted iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif. [SEP]
[CLS] The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, <e2>France</e2>, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.” The firm believes with “medium confidence” that <e1>Sneaky Kestrel</e1> acts on behalf of the UAE.

[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called <e1>Ahrar Maps</e1> made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham. “There is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,” according to the report. “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.” In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. “These classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,” according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to Special Technology Center (STC), a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U.S. government under President Obama, for interfering in the <e2>2016</e2> presidential elections.

[CLS] However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in <e2>Canada</e2> as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes. [SEP]
[CLS] In another case cited in the <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of <e1>National Security Agency</e1> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. [SEP]
[CLS] TangleBot: New text message-based malware capable of defrauding Android users The Nigerian Communications Commission (<e2>NCC</e2>) recently announced the existence of a new high-risk, a critical and short messaging service-based malware named TangleBot. In a press statement released by the commission, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, Director of Public Affairs, explained that TangleBot only infects Android mobile devices. He added that: “The disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission’s New Media and Information Security Department by the Nigerian <e1>Computer Emergency Response Team</e1> (ngCERT).

[CLS] With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg <e2>Morocco</e2> Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.K. U.S. While there were 10 downloader apps in the Google Play Store at the time of this writing, the campaign is rather hefty. X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster’s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. <e1>IBM X-Force</e1> reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. [SEP]
[CLS] It had again cloned a different legitimate Japanese website to host its malicious app, similar to what <e1>FakeSpy</e1> had also done before. Their similarity is made more apparent by looking at their naming method for downloadable files, domain structure of fake websites and other details of their deployment techniques, exemplified in figure 10. XLoader 6.0 also mirrors the way FakeSpy hides its real C&C server. When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the Twitter platform, something FakeSpy has done in its past attacks. Analysis of the malicious iOS profile also revealed further connections, as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that FakeSpy deployed early this year. Conclusion and security recommendations The continued monitoring of XLoader showed how its operators continuously changed its features, such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques. This newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won’t be stopping soon. Being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies, as well as prepare for upcoming attacks. In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we’ve also seen in a different malware family like FakeSpy also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Timeline of posts related to the Hacking Team DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits – two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel—were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their <e1>Remote Control System (RCS)</e1> agent installed in their targets’ systems. [SEP]
[CLS] As the team at Scandinavian security group <e2>CSIS</e2> describes, malware known as MazarBOT is being distributed via SMS in Denmark and is likely to also be encountered in other countries. Victims’ first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their Android smartphone receives. The txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable Android application. CSIS provided a (sanitised) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for: “You have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link http://www.mmsforyou[.]net/mms.apk to view the message” Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, MazarBOT downloads a copy of Tor onto users’ Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim’s location to an Iranian mobile phone number. With the malware now in place, a number of actions can be performed, including allowing attackers to secretly monitor and control smartphones via a backdoor, send messages to premium-rate numbers, and intercept two-factor authentication codes sent by online banking apps and the like. In fact, with full access to the compromised Android smartphone, the opportunities for criminals to wreak havoc are significant – such as erasing infected phones or launching man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In its analysis, CSIS notes that MazarBOT was reported by <e1>Recorded Future</e1> last November as being actively sold in Russian underground forums and intriguingly, the malware will not activate on Android devices configured with Russian language settings.

[CLS] Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot <e1>Gustuff</e1> DiseaseBot Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape. The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the <e2>Americas</e2>: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

[CLS] <e1>Alien</e1> - the story of Cerberus' demise Intro As predicted in our blog 2020 – year of the RAT, 2020 has been an effervescent year for financially motivated threat actors making use of Android malware. Although the ThreatFabric team discovered several new banking Trojans, it also observed the death of some others. Threat actors continue to innovate and try out new ways to steal and monetize personal information. In some cases, actors are successful, with long-running campaigns powered by their malware, in other cases, they are fruitless, resulting in the downfall of their malware, as quickly as it appeared. In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known Android banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed Alien, and explain how it relates to infamous Cerberus malware, who’s service has recently been discontinued. The preface, Cerberus August 2020 marked the demise of Cerberus, the most successful Android banking Trojan service, or MaaS (Malware as a Service), of the last 12 months. Details about the Trojan can be found in our blog about from August last year. Apparently due to issues related to shortcomings of the staff within the threat actor’s technical team, architectural and technical issues with the Trojan remained unsolved long enough for Google Play Protect to detect all related samples on the spot on all infected devices, of course resulting in unhappy customers. At the <e2>end of July</e2>, because of these issues, the actor behind Cerberus tried to sell the service, including the customer portfolio, in the hopes another actor would continue his work. [SEP]

[CLS] In this campaign, the malicious downloader apps X-Force detected have the same code base as three apps that <e2>ThreatFabric</e2> reported in January 2018. The following characteristics show the similarity: The resemblance is even more striking in the figure below. By removing all the key instances (**pE2**) from the string, we produced the same string from the January sample: With 10 downloaders at this point, the campaign appears to be scaling up. Over time, we’ve seen the code evolve. As time went by between downloader versions, the developers added a simple obfuscation and expanded the downloader capabilities. The code was also altered slightly to avoid detection by Google Play’s security controls. According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. Anubis Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> from one of its C&C servers. [SEP]
[CLS] 0 (Detected by Trend Micro as <e1>ANDROIDOS_BANKER</e1>) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both Android and Flash Player. Once a user downloads one of these malicious apps into their devices and opens it, a popup overlay will appear prompting the user to enter their login credentials. The credentials are then sent to a Command and Control (C&C server) that the attackers control. Red Alert 2.0 will block incoming calls from banks, presumably to block verification attempts. The malware also intercepts SMS text messages, sending messages to the attackers for future use. By disrupting the device’s actual communication capabilities, the attackers can maximize the time spent doing malicious activities. According to its researchers, Red Alert 2.0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500—a low price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers. Red Alert 2.0 can target mobile devices that are running Android versions of up to 6.0, which was released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores. No versions of the malicious apps carrying the malware have been detected on the official Google Play Store as of the time of publication. This is not the first time that malware is being spread via third party app stores, as seen in last year’s <e2>Fobus</e2> attack involving Super Mario Run. [SEP]
[CLS] On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that <e1>maza-in</e1> and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “Anubis 3” malware on an underground forum. His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot <e2>Bubabot</e2> Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

[CLS] Another app takes two malware types, called <e2>Desert Scorpion</e2> and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker "a considerable amount of control over a compromised device." The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed <e1>APT-C-23</e1> is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. [SEP]
[CLS] Ginp Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as <e1>AndroidOS_Ginp.HRXB</e1>) to steal user login credentials and credit card details. ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting <e2>Snapchat</e2> and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Lookout</e1> Discovers Phishing Sites Distributing New IOS And Android Surveillanceware Background: Android surveillanceware Early last year, Lookout discovered a sophisticated Android surveillanceware agent that appears to have been created for the lawful intercept market. The agent appears to have been under development for at least five years and consists of three stages. First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. Security Without Borders has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features. Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named Connexxa S.R.L. and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016. Lookout notified <e2>Google</e2> of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. [SEP]
[CLS] Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. <e1>APT-C-23</e1> has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across <e2>Facebook</e2>, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. [SEP]
[CLS] The so-called <e1>ViperRAT</e1> malware was incorporated into two apps, and it has previously targeted members of the Israeli Defense Force. Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine.

In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component.

[CLS] ” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an <e2>Italy</e2>-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers. Researchers said that a company called eSurv S.R.L. was also involved. eSurv was once a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L. in 2014. In 2016, the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa to eSurv S.R.L. It’s not clear how many iPhones were infected by the iOS apps. The iOS variant isn’t as sophisticated as Exodus was. Unlike Exodus, the iOS version wasn’t observed to use exploits. Instead, it relied on documented programming interfaces. It was nonetheless able to exfiltrate a variety of sensitive data including: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information Tell-tale signs Because the iOS variant relied on Apple-provided APIs, the malware provided alert users with some tell-tale signs that would have alerted vigilant users that their sensitive data was being tracked. For instance, the first time the malware attempted to access location data, an infected phone would have displayed the following dialogue, asking for permission: <e1>Lookout</e1> researchers reported their findings to Apple, and the company revoked the enterprise certificate.

[CLS] The NSO Group spokesman told <e2>The Post</e2> that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of <e1>National Security Agency</e1> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on <e2>social media apps</e2> WhatsApp and Telegram. The malware, Android/SpyC32.A, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>). [SEP]
[CLS] The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named <e1>FrozenCell</e1> - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running <e2>Facebook</e2> profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the <e1>Yanbian Gang</e1> noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices. This variant is distributed via smishing. XLoader version 6.0 abuses <e2>Twitter</e2> profiles to hide its C&C server. [SEP]
[CLS] In this second version, the developer’s name listed was “concipit1248” in <e2>Google Play</e2>, and may have been active between May 2019 to February 2020. This app appears to have become unavailable on Google Play in March 2020. The second Project Spy version has similar capabilities to the first version, with the addition of the following: Stealing notification messages sent from WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram Abandoning the FTP mode of uploading the recorded images Aside from changing the app’s supposed function and look, the second and third versions’ codes had little differences. Potentially malicious iOS connection Using the codes and “<e1>Concipit1248</e1>” to check for more versions, we found two other apps in the App Store. [SEP]
[CLS] The HackingTeam’s <e2>RCS</e2> delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and <e1>AppleApplicationSupport64.msi,</e1> part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. [SEP]
[CLS] The <e2>Moscow</e2>-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the U.S. reported the second largest attacks (17.17%) and Hong Kong stood third (4.81%). Earlier, Kaspersky uncovered AppleJeus, a malicious operation by North Korea’s cyber-hacking outfit ‘Lazarus Group’ to intrude on cryptocurrency exchanges and applications. According to an official report, Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (<e1>GReAT</e1>) discovered the unusual activity of attackers who penetrated the network of an Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange using Trojanized trading software to steal cryptocurrencies.

[CLS] Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey A few weeks ago, <e2>IBM</e2>’s Trusteer team found evidence that Ginp malware developers intend to broaden their target set to customers of <e1>Turkish banks</e1>, after targeting Spanish banking customers and customers in Poland and the United Kingdom. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>SpyNote</e1> malware: One more reason to never sideload Android apps Jack Wallen explains why the recently discovered SpyNote malware threat should make you squeamish about sideloading Android apps. On a semi-regular basis, I receive emails from users who have Android devices that show all the signs of being infected by malware. Without fail and without question, I quickly discover the user installed an application from a third-party, untrusted source. The user wanted an app, so they googled the app, and clicked on the first search result. Under normal circumstances, that first result is the Google Play Store. But when the app is not free, some users will turn to sites that promise to hand out that same application, sans cost. Recently a new security threat emerged that should make everyone squeamish about sideloading Android applications. What is sideloading? With the Android platform, you can install applications in the normal fashion (i.e., by finding them on the Google Play Store and tapping Install), or you can download the APK file (a file ending with .apk) and install it by tapping that file from within a file manager on your Android device. When you install via the second approach–which is called sideloading–you bypass all of the security checks done via the Google Play Store’s vetting process. That is when trouble occurs. Many times those applications found on less-than-reputable sites can even seem like the same versions of legitimate apps. You might think you’re installing Pokemon Go, but what you’re really installing is a version of that particular app with baked-in malicious code. How does this happen? A recent discovery by Palo Alto One Networks’ <e2>Unit 42</e2> team illustrates this perfectly. [SEP]
[CLS] The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. <e2>Amazon</e2> said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the <e1>Department of Justice</e1> is investigating, according to the Times. [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] Origins: It all started with <e1>BankBot</e1> In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e2>LokiBot</e2> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code. [SEP]
[CLS] In the background, the injection’s code couples the phone number inserted by the victim with the bot ID the <e1>Ursnif</e1> malware assigned to that infected desktop, the bank’s name the victim uses and their login credentials as grabbed by Ursnif. Notice the use of the word ‘Jambo’ in parts of the code. It is most likely that Ursnif’s operators wrote a jQuery library to simplify HTML Document Object Model tree traversal and manipulation, using it to orchestrate their injections. Fraudsters can use the library to define the amounts to transfer from accounts and other parameters of the fraudulent transaction. If the victims submit their phone number on the web injection, the remote server will send back a download URL for them to unknowingly download the Cerberus malware. This injection also keeps the victims’ device identifiers linked to their bot ID and account credentials. Cerberus in Action Cerberus campaigns have already been detected spreading through the official Google Play store in the past, but this distribution attempts to land on victim devices through a third-party source — the attacker’s domains. The option to sideload APKs is not enabled by default on Android devices, and the choice to deliver the malware from a non-official source may have limited the spread of the campaign to a larger number of devices. When Cerberus is downloaded to a new device, it takes into account the original bank name the victim attempted to access when the infection process was initiated. A JavaScript function includes those details and ensures the victim continues to see a consistent message. Here too, the ‘Jambo’ word repeats throughout the function, calling into action the jQuery library that orchestrates the malware’s script-based activity. Cerberus is being used here only as the component that allows the attackers to bypass the bank’s SMS-code verification challenge. The fraudulent transaction itself takes place on the victims’ infected desktops (Windows-based devices). While most fraud is in-session using <e2>Gozi SOCK</e2> proxy capability, some access to the victim’s account came from other devices. [SEP]
[CLS] This malware sold to governments could help them spy on iPhones, researchers say Many people assume their iPhones are secure, but new research sent <e1>Apple</e1> scrambling to fix vulnerabilities that left users at risk. Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaws in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. "This is the most sophisticated bad actor we have ever seen targeting mobile phones out in the wild," said Mike Murray, vice president of security research at Lookout. The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. "We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits," the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. "The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes," the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2> jails. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers believe that some of TrickMo’s functionalities, specifically the ability to record targeted applications, help the trojan obtain a one-time password (OTP) or transaction authentication number, with the goal of bypassing 2FA protections put in place by <e1>banks</e1>. “We believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app-recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks,” they said. Bypassing Authentication In most places, 2FA is implemented by sending an SMS message containing a OTP to a user’s mobile device. However, SMS messages, as previous hacks have proved, can be intercepted. So, some banks in <e2>Europe</e2> (and especially in Germany) have taken these types of authentication measures a step further by using an app that sends push notifications to users (rather than texts). [SEP]
[CLS] The Flash zero-day exploit (<e2>CVE-2015-5119</e2>) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan. July 11 Two new Flash zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5123, were found in the hacking team dump. July 13 Further analysis of the hacking team dump revealed that the company used UEFI BIOS rootkit to keep their Remote Control System (RCS) agent installed in their targets’ systems. July 14 A new zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-2425) was found in Internet Explorer. July 16 On the mobile front, a fake news app designed to bypass <e1>Google Play</e1> was discovered. [SEP]
[CLS] Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from <e1>Security Without Borders</e1> found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local Italian internet service provider (ISP). They said the spyware was capable of rooting Android devices and possessed an advanced set of spying features that gave attackers full control of infected devices. Security Without Borders said it detected nearly 25 different Exodus-infected apps that had been uploaded on the Play Store over the last two years. LESS-SOPHISTICATED EXODUS IOS VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit conference, the team at <e2>Lookout</e2> said it discovered an iOS variant of this spyware during their analysis of Exodus samples they've found last year. [SEP]
[CLS] Following screenshot shows this functionality in action: Other functions In addition to the functionalities we’ve described, the <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1> was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware. SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C. The screenshot below shows SpyNote RAT scanning for Wi-Fi and enabling it if a known channel is found: Additional features - SpyNote RAT could click photos using the device's camera, based on commands from C&C. - There were two interesting sub-classes found inside Main Activity: Receiver and Sender. Receiver was involved in receiving commands from the Server and the main functionality of Sender was to send all the data collected to the C&C over Wi-Fi. - SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device’s location to identify the exact location of the victim. SpyNote RAT builder The SpyNote Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness. What we found were several other fake apps developed using the SpyNote builder, which should come as a warning to Android users. Some of the targeted apps were: Whatsapp YouTube Video Downloader Google Update Instagram Hack Wifi AirDroid WifiHacker Facebook Photoshop SkyTV Hotstar Trump Dash PokemonGo With many more to come. Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of <e2>2017</e2>, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same SpyNote Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild.

[CLS] Once <e2>Gooligan</e2> has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The <e1>Chinese cybercriminals</e1> behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. [SEP]

[CLS] The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious <e1>Ryuk</e1> ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials. Abusing Android's <e2>Accessibility Features</e2> to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the CERT-Bund last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices. [SEP]
[CLS] To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as VROOT and Towelroot, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, <e2>KitKat</e2> and Lollipop. Together, those operating systems account for 74 per cent of Android devices in use today, totalling around 1.03 billion. Most infections (40 per cent) are in Asia, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in North America, Shaulov said. Another 12 per cent are based in Europe.

[CLS] In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we’ve also seen in a different malware family like <e2>FakeSpy</e2> also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called <e1>adb.exe,</e1> which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. [SEP]

[CLS] The team recently reported that <e2>downloader</e2> apps in the store are being used as the first step in an infection routine that fetches the Marcher (aka Marcher ExoBot) and BankBot Anubis mobile banking Trojans. Users who unknowingly install the app on their devices are subsequently infected. Cybercriminals use these banking Trojans to facilitate financial fraud by stealing login credentials to banking apps, e-wallets and payment cards. Starting in June, our team discovered a number of new malware downloader samples that infect users with BankBot Anubis (aka <e1>Go_P00t</e1>). [SEP]

In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data.

[CLS] <e1>Hacking Team</e1> Spying Tool Listens to Calls Following news that iOS devices are at risk of spyware related to the Hacking Team, the saga continues into the Android sphere. We found that among the leaked files is the code for Hacking Team’s open-source malware suite RCSAndroid (Remote Control System Android), which was sold by the company as a tool for monitoring targets. (Researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014.) The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware ever exposed. The leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations. Based on the leaked code, the RCSAndroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets: Capture screenshots using the “screencap” command and framebuffer direct reading Monitor clipboard content Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online acco;.unts, including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Google, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Mail, and LinkedIn Record using the microphone Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Record location Gather device information Capture photos using the front and back cameras Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Line, WeChat, Hangouts, Telegram, and BlackBerry Messenger.

[CLS] Similarly to another Android spyware made in Italy, originally discovered by Lukas Stefanko and later named <e1>Skygofree</e1> and analyzed in depth by Kaspersky Labs, Exodus also takes advantage of "protectedapps", a feature in Huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications. By manipulating a SQLite database, Exodus is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground.

[CLS] The disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission’s New Media and Information Security Department by the <e1>Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT)</e1>. TangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur. The aim behind both or either of the messages (on COVID-19 or impending power outages) is to encourage potential victims to follow a link that supposedly offers detailed information. Once at the page, users are asked to update applications such as Adobe Flash Player to view the page’s content by going through nine (9) dialogue boxes to give acceptance to different permissions that will allow the malware operators initiate the malware configuration process. The immediate consequence to this, is that TangleBot gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications. The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things. Furthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the Android operating system. The NCC, therefore, wishes to, once again, urge millions of telecom consumers in <e2>Nigeria</e2> to be wary of such wiles of cyber criminals, whose intent is to defraud unsuspecting Internet users.

[CLS] This may imply the “<e2>Concipit1248</e2>” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app’s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a “right time” to inject the malicious codes. It’s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and “incubation.” As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app’s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

[CLS] Most of the titles are in English with a handful in Arabic and Russian. <e1>Monokle</e1> has likely been used to spy on individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria. Recent samples of Monokle include the Xposed framework that allows Android users to apply modules to an Android device’s ROM(Read Only Memory). Some Monokle fake apps include Xposed modules that implement functionality for hooking and hiding presence in the process list Much of the core malicious functionality implemented in the later samples of Monokle use an XOR obfuscated DEX file in the assets folder. “The functionality hidden in this DEX file includes all cryptographic functions implemented in the open source library spongycastle11, various e-mail protocols, extraction and exfiltration of all data, serialisation and deserialisation of data using the Thrift protocol, and rooting and hooking functionality, among others ” continues the report. As anticipated, Monokle was developed by STC, the experts noticed that Monokle and the STC’s Android security suite called Defender are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure. “Command and control infrastructure that communicates with the Defender application also communicates with Monokle samples. The signing certificates used for signing Android application packages overlap between Defender and Monokle as well.” continues the report. “Additional overlap was observed by Lookout researchers between Monokle and the defensive security software produced by STC in the authors’ development and implementation choices.” Researchers revealed that there is evidence that an <e2>iOS</e2> version of Monokle is in development, even if they have no evidence of active iOS infections [SEP]
[CLS] According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company <e1>Q-Cyber</e1> is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. <e2>Amazon</e2> said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper.

[CLS] New Malware campaign <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> targeting Android Devices: Researchers Security researchers revealed an ongoing Android malware campaign dubbed ViceLeaker that has been active since 2016. According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named Triout. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. “In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,” Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the <e2>first quarter of 2019</e2> compared to Q4 of 2018. [SEP]

[CLS] Ginp Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as <e1>AndroidOS_Ginp.HRXB</e1>) to steal user login credentials and credit card details. ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the <e2>Anubis</e2> malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. [SEP]
[CLS] First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. <e2>Security Without Borders</e2> has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features.

[CLS] New malware seizes on COVID-19 to target Android users A new form of malware that experts are referring to as "<e1>TangleBot</e1>" is relying on interest in COVID-19 to trick Android users in the U.S and Canada into clicking on a link that will infect their cell phones, according to analysts at the mobile and email security company Cloudmark. Cloudmark says the "clever and complicated" malware sends Android users a text message claiming to have the latest COVID-19 guidance in their area or informs them that their third COVID-19 vaccine appointment has been scheduled. When users click on the link provided, they're prompted to update their phone's Adobe Flash player, which instead installs the virus on their phone, according to Cloudmark. Here's what such a text message might look like, according to Cloudmark: "Once that happens, the TangleBot malware can do a ton of different things," <e2>Ryan Kalember</e2>, executive vice president of cybersecurity at Cloudmark's parent company ProofPoint, told CBS News.

[CLS] In the past, <e1>NSO Group</e1> delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.” The firm believes with “medium confidence” that Sneaky Kestrel acts on behalf of the UAE. It normally targets individuals inside the UAE, and one target hacked by the group previously received Pegasus links via SMS that “point to the same domain name used in the attacks on UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.” It’s also with medium confidence that the researchers assess that Monarchy acts on behalf of the <e2>Saudi government</e2>. It targets individuals primarily inside Saudi Arabia, and was seen hacking a Saudi Arabian activist. [SEP]

[CLS] ” Sample Downloader Campaign From Current Analyses In the current campaign, according to <e2>X-Force</e2> researchers, the downloader apps target Turkish-speaking users. They differ in type and visual style — from online shopping to financial services and even an automotive app — and are designed to look legitimate and enticing to users. The variety of apps and styles indicates a large investment of resources on the part of the campaign’s operators, suggesting that a cybercrime service, rather than a single cybercrime faction, is likely responsible. The downloaders themselves are rather stealthy, and VirusTotal missed all but one of the samples. The one that was found had zero detections by antivirus engines. In this campaign, the malicious downloader apps X-Force detected have the same code base as three apps that ThreatFabric reported in January 2018. The following characteristics show the similarity: The resemblance is even more striking in the figure below. By removing all the key instances (**pE2**) from the string, we produced the same string from the January sample: With 10 downloaders at this point, the campaign appears to be scaling up. Over time, we’ve seen the code evolve. As time went by between downloader versions, the developers added a simple obfuscation and expanded the downloader capabilities. The code was also altered slightly to avoid detection by Google Play’s security controls. According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. <e1>Anubis</e1> Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches BankBot Anubis from one of its C&C servers.

The newest Anubis acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the fake Orange app is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to <e1>Lookout</e1>’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S. [SEP]
[CLS] Hacking Team used text and email messages containing specially crafted URLs that triggered exploits for several vulnerabilities (<e2>CVE-2012-2825</e2> and CVE-2012-2871) present in the default browsers of Android 4.0 Ice Cream to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing the attacker to gain root privileges, and install the RCSAndroid APK. 2.

[CLS] Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan <e1>Anubis</e1> – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at Lookout warned in a new report. And it’s not just customers of big banks at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted. Infosec Insiders Newsletter “As a banking trojan malware, Anubis’ goal is to collect significant data about the victim from their mobile device for financial gain,” the Lookout report said. “This is done by intercepting SMSs, keylogging, file exfiltration, screen monitoring, GPS data collection and abuse of the device’s accessibility services.” The malicious version of the Orange Telecom account management app was submitted to the Google Play store in July 2021 and later removed, but the researchers warned that they believe this campaign was just a test of Google’s antivirus protections and will likely resurface soon. “We found that obfuscation efforts were only partially implemented within the app and that there were additional developments still occurring with its command-and-control (C2) server,” the report added. “We expect more heavily obfuscated distributions will be submitted in the future.” New Anubis Tricks Once downloaded on the device, the banking trojan makes a connection with the command-and-control (C2) server and downloads another application to initiate the SOCKS5 proxy. “This proxy allows the attacker to enforce authentication for clients communicating with their server and mask communications between the client and C2. Once retrieved and decrypted, the APK is saved as ‘FR.apk’ in ‘/data/data/fr.orange.serviceapp/app_apk,'” the researchers wrote. A scam message then pops up asking the user to disable <e2>Google Play</e2> Protect, giving the attacker full control, the report said. [SEP]

[CLS] But new data published today by Citizen Lab researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the Pegasus spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, Canada, <e2>Switzerland</e2>, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place. Citizen Lab says ten of these 36 groups appear to be conducting surveillance in multiple countries and have not limited their spying inside their own country's borders, an act that may violate surveillance laws active in the states where Pegasus victims may be located. Citizen Lab researchers admitted that some of their findings may be inaccurate, as some targets may using VPN and satellite connections that may place their location in another country. But they also say this doesn't rule out that some Pegasus operators may be spying on dissidents living abroad, even in Western and well-developed countries where cross-border surveillance against their own citizens is strictly forbidden. In a statement provided to Citizen Lab researchers before the publication of today's report, an NSO Group spokesperson denied that the company was breaking any software export laws, adhering to the previously stated dogma that they're only selling Pegasus for crime-fighting purposes. "Contrary to statements made by [Citizen Lab], our product is licensed to government and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investigating and preventing crime and terror. Our business is conducted in strict compliance with applicable export control laws." To this statement, Citizen Lab responded with their own, pointing out that NSO Group, even after three years, continues to fail to see the reason the company is being heavily criticized online, and that's for selling Pegasus to oppressive regimes in the first place. "Citizen Lab research does not speak to what statements <e1>NSO</e1> may make during marketing, sales, or export compliance. [SEP]
[CLS] ” The <e1>ViceLeaker</e1> APK implements very common spyware features (exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs, and device information) along with backdoor capabilities (upload, download, delete files, camera takeover, and record surrounding audio). ViceLeaker leverages HTTP for C&C communications and to transfer exfiltrated data. During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “Conversations.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app. The modified Conversations app mimics Telegram messenger, but experts did not find any malicious activity implemented by this specific app. “Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn’t discover anything malicious in it,” continues Kaspersky. “This brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind ViceLeaker for internal communication or for other, unclear purposes.” Experts were aware of the possibility that threat actors might be using a compromised email account, investigating it they found a personal page and a <e2>GitHub</e2> account that contains a forked Conversation repository.

Android bots have also already been found being controlled via other non-traditional means – blogs or some of the many cloud messaging systems like <e1>Google</e1>’s or Baidu’s – but Twitoor is the first Twitter-based bot malware, according to Štefanko.

[CLS] As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as <e2>online banking</e2> credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of “customers”; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers’ money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis’ evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e1>“Android.BankBot.149.origin”</e1>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. [SEP]
[CLS] The most recent warning of Android malware relates to a new banking trojan called <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> that has managed to infiltrate a number of third-party app stores using a variety of disguises including bogus WhatsApp and Viber apps as well as malicious Flash Player updates. As researchers from <e2>SfyLabs</e2> detail, RedAlert 2. [SEP]
[CLS] The Lookout team couldn’t find any successful attack associated with the <e1>Orange S.A.</e1> campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told <e2>Threatpost</e2>. “While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U. [SEP]
[CLS] Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1> suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to <e2>2015</e2>. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware overlays login screens for banking apps, stealing credentials for its operators. <e1>Cerberus</e1> also has a crafty evasion technique—using the accelerometer on an infected device to ensure the target is real and not a desk-based security analyst. The developers behind Cerberus are reportedly renting the trojan out on the dark web and have taken the unusual step of advertising their capabilities on Twitter. The threat actors even use their Twitter account to mock the security community tasked with trying to stop them—and they are so confident, they even tried to sell the bot to a well known malware analyst so he could examine their work. Cerberus infects users when they access a fake website which immediately requests a download of Adobe Flash Player. The download is fake, and carries the malware payload. Android banking trojans are nothing new, and Cerberus is just the latest in a long line of such malware to hit the headlines. Even the fact that Cerberus is being "rented out" on underground forums is not unique. Malware "for hire" has become a theme. Cerberus has been designed to steal banking credentials. It does this—again not unusually—by creating overlays on top of banking apps that capture usernames and passwords as they are being entered. Such overlays are designed around specific apps, and Cerberus has developed more than 30 of these thus far. Of note, the target <e2>banks</e2> are in the U. [SEP]
[CLS] One brochure for the <e1>NSO Group</e1> advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed Pegasus, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of <e2>National Security Agency</e2> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. [SEP]

[CLS] Zero-Click Apple Zero-Day Uncovered in <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spy Attack The phones of 36 journalists were infected by four APTs, possibly linked to Saudi Arabia or the UAE. Four nation-state-backed advanced persistent threats (APTs) hacked Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors and executives, in an espionage attack leveraging a zero-day exploit for Apple iPhone, researchers said. The attack, carried out in July and August, compromised 36 personal phones belonging to the victims, according to <e2>Citizen Lab</e2>. The firm said that the perpetrators could belong to up to four APTs, including potentially those linked to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. [SEP]
[CLS] Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, <e2>India</e2>, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using <e1>Twitter</e1> and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. [SEP]

[CLS] Recent updates The rental of <e1>Anubis 2</e1> was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. During Q1 2019, actor maza-in vanished from the threat landscape, leaving existing customers without support and updates. Although exact details about the vanishing of the actor remain unclear at the time of writing, a chain of events confirms that some abnormal activity took place around Anubis and its author. On December 13 2018 maza-in announces the release of Anubis 2.5; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code. On <e2>January 16 2019</e2> Anubis code is leaked in an underground forum (both backend code and unobfuscated APK). [SEP]
[CLS] TJ Short, VP Security Operations at <e1>Cerberus Sentinel</e1>, says the trojan employs ingenious methods to trick users. “The coolest feature, though, is that once you connect to your bank, complete your MFA and finish your bank business, it will activate. So when you are finished with the transaction, it will keep the tunnel open that has already passed the MFA requirements pop up a fake ‘transaction has ended jpeg’ for you to see. At that point, it will contact the C2 server and act as a proxy gateway allowing the attacker to access your financial information.” Newer features coming to Anubis banking trojan The Anubis banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the <e2>United States</e2> and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. [SEP]
[CLS] However, <e1>DualToy</e1> assumes any physically connected mobile devices will belong to the same owner as the infected PC to which they are connected, which means the pairing is likely already authorized. DualToy tries to reuse existing pairing records to directly interact with mobile devices in the background. Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms. Infecting Android Devices Almost all samples of DualToy are capable of infecting Android devices connected with the compromised Windows PC via USB cable. This functionality is usually implemented in a module named NewPhone.dll, DevApi.dll or app.dll. DualToy assumes ADB is enabled on the connected Android device. If ADB isn't enabled (which is the default option), the . However, some users, especially those who want to install Android apps from a PC or Mac, or who want to do advanced operations with their Android devices, This is because ADB is both the only official interface for a Windows or <e2>Mac</e2> computer to operate an Android device via USB and it is a debugging interface.

[CLS] Similarly to another Android spyware made in Italy, originally discovered by Lukas Stefanko and later named <e1>Skygofree</e1> and analyzed in depth by Kaspersky Labs, Exodus also takes advantage of "protectedapps", a feature in Huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications. By manipulating a SQLite database, Exodus is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the <e2>Facebook</e2> app. [SEP]
[CLS] The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the <e1>Times</e1> wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An NSO Group spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality. The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations. However, researchers at the Toronto-based Citizen Lab have identified its tools in use in dozens of countries, including to target Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada as part of an asylum program. Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in <e2>Turkey</e2>, tortured, and murdered last year. [SEP]

Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks <e1>MysteryBot</e1> (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind “LokiBot”, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

[CLS] In a previous campaign reported by <e2>JPCERT</e2>, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. Deutsche Post - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn. La Poste - La Poste is a public limited postal service company in France. <e1>Japan Post</e1> - A private Japanese post, logistics and courier headquartered in Tokyo. [SEP]

[CLS] NSO Group has denied its involvement in that case. <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of Pegasus’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime messages or notifications. Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV. “Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,” according to Citizen Lab. KISMET likely doesn’t work against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections, Citizen Labs noted. Apple meanwhile is looking into the issue. Inside One Victim’s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, France, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, <e2>Choopa</e2>, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]
[CLS] Android Spyware Variant Snoops on WhatsApp, Telegram Messages The Android malware comes from threat group APT-C-23, also known as <e2>Two-Tailed Scorpion</e2> and Desert Scorpion. Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram. The malware, Android/SpyC32.A, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones. “Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,” according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. “Android/SpyC32.A – the group’s newest spyware version – features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.” APT-C-23’s activities – including its mobile malware – were first described in 2017 by several security research teams. Meanwhile, the updated version, <e1>Android/SpyC23.A</e1>, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020. [SEP]

The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified <e1>Google</e1> on April 3. [SEP]
[CLS] Avast has notified Google about the malicious app; <e2>Threatpost</e2> has reached out to Google for further comment on whether the app is still available on Google Play. “The version in Google Play currently does not contain the dropper code anymore – the app was updated with a new version, which is benign again,” David told Threatpost. “We can only speculate why the threat actors are doing this. It could be they are testing different options with this app, including whether and when Google or external cybersecurity researchers detect the malicious code. So far, we have not received a response from Google yet.” The Evolving Cerberus Threat Cerberus first emerged last August on underground forums, being offered in a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. Since then a newly discovered variant of the Cerberus Android trojan has been spotted, with vastly expanded and more sophisticated info-harvesting capabilities, and the ability to run TeamViewer. It’s only the latest malware family to be discovered on a legitimate app marketplace. In February, researchers identified eight malicious Android apps on Google Play distributing the “Haken” malware, which exfiltrates sensitive data from victims and covertly signs them up for expensive premium subscription services.

He started to share tips and tricks to help other threat actors deal with technical issues and enhance their own malware. Shortly after the initial article, the actor even conducted an interview with Forbes magazine named “I Want To Expose Google’s Mistakes”, stating that he published the malicious code to improve the state of Android security, by showing design flaws in the system that can be easily abused. He also frequently reviewed each new Android banking Trojan available for renting. In his reviews, he evaluated the technical capabilities and provided his opinion about the actor. Later, a review by maza-in almost became a de facto step to start rental of Android banking malware, as users of forums were asking for the review before they would buy/rent a new Trojan. Although claiming to have the most noble intentions, maza-in also pursued more nefarious goals. Information from forums shows that at the same time he shared the code of the Trojan in the tutorial article, he was developing a “full” version of the Trojan privately. After some time he started to privately rent it. The malware was heavily enhanced compared to its original version, adding modern overlaying techniques, device screen recording and streaming, a network proxy feature, keylogging and the ability to steal files from the infected device. maza-in names the malware Anubis and used the following logo in his advertisement of the malware: The list of bot features below shows how much maza-in improved upon the original shared <e2>BankBot</e2> code to create (the latest version of) Anubis: Overlaying: Static (hardcoded in bot) Overlaying: Dynamic (C2 based) Keylogging Contact list collection Screen streaming Sound recording SMS harvesting: SMS forwarding SMS blocking SMS sending Files/pictures collection Calls: USSD request making Ransomware: Cryptolocker Remote actions: Data-wiping Remote actions: Back-connect proxy Notifications: Push notifications C2 Resilience: Twitter/Telegram/Pastebin C2 update channels In addition to the new features and improvements made, Anubis also has a larger (default) target list.

This app appears to have become unavailable on Google Play in March 2020. The second Project Spy version has similar capabilities to the first version, with the addition of the following: Stealing notification messages sent from WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram Abandoning the FTP mode of uploading the recorded images Aside from changing the app’s supposed function and look, the second and third versions’ codes had little differences. Potentially malicious iOS connection Using the codes and “Concipit1248” to check for more versions, we found two other apps in the App Store. Further analysis of the iOS app “Concipit1248” showed that the server used, spy[.]cashnow[.]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of Project Spy. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating. The other iOS app “Concipit Shop” from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The “Corona Updates” app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, <e2>Grenada</e2>, and Russia. [SEP]
[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout’s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called <e1>Ahrar Maps</e1> made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham. “There is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,” according to the report. “Based on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of <e2>Eastern Europe</e2>; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called ‘UzbekChat’ referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.

[CLS] A new variant of <e1>Cerberus</e1> banking trojan, called Alien, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America & Microsoft Outlook. The newly uncovered banking Alien trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials! When it has infected a device, the RAT tries to take passwords from at least 226 mobile applications; including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking & Capital One Mobile, as well as many collaboration & social apps e.g. Snapchat, Telegram & Microsoft Outlook. Underground Forums The malware, which was 1st advertised for rent on underground forums in Jan., has actively targeted institutions globally, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the UK & the US. Researchers think Alien is a “fork” of the infamous Cerberus banking malware, which has had a steady reduction in use over the last year. Variant “Based on our in-depth knowledge of the trojan, we can prove that the Alien malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early <e2>Jan. 2020</e2> & rented out at the same time as Cerberus,” observed researchers with Threat Fabric, in a Thursday analysis.

[CLS] and Europe or the <e1>CovidLock</e1> Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients. But its wide-ranging access to mobile device functions is what sets it apart, Cloudmark researchers said. “The malware has been given the moniker TangleBot because of its many levels of obfuscation and control over a myriad of entangled device functions, including contacts, SMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet access, [GPS], and camera and microphone,” they noted in a Thursday writeup. To reach such a long arm into Android’s internal business, TangleBot grants itself privileges to access and control all of the above, researchers said, meaning that the cyberattackers would now have carte blanche to mount attacks with a staggering array of goals. For instance, attackers can manipulate the incoming voice call function to block calls and can also silently make calls in the background, with users none the wiser. That’s a perfect setup for premium number fraud, where the user is charged a high rate for making a call to an attacker-controlled toll number. TangleBot can also send, obtain and process text messages for SMS fraud, two-factor authentication interception, self-propagation to contacts and more. It also has deep spyware capabilities, with the ability to record or directly stream camera, screen or microphone audio directly to the attacker, along with “other device observation capabilities,” according to Cloudmark. Gaining access to the GPS functionality, for example, creates the potential for stalkery location-tracking. And last but not least, the firm noted that the malware can take stock of installed applications and interact with them, as well as place overlay screens on top of these to, say, harvest credentials in the style of a <e2>banking trojan</e2>. “The ability to detect installed apps, app interactions and inject overlay screens is extremely problematic,” researchers noted.

They tend to target any antivirus protections on the device and uninstall them, which increases the possibility of their malware persisting on the device. Following screenshot shows this functionality in action: Other functions In addition to the functionalities we’ve described, the SpyNote RAT was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware. SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C. The screenshot below shows SpyNote RAT scanning for Wi-Fi and enabling it if a known channel is found: Additional features - SpyNote RAT could click photos using the device's camera, based on commands from C&C. - There were two interesting sub-classes found inside Main Activity: Receiver and Sender. Receiver was involved in receiving commands from the Server and the main functionality of Sender was to send all the data collected to the C&C over Wi-Fi. - SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device’s location to identify the exact location of the victim. SpyNote RAT builder The <e1>SpyNote</e1> Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness. [SEP]

[CLS] Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push <e2>Trojan</e2> Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Researchers have warned that over half of Android devices are still susceptible to Ghost Push malware. Read More According to Check Point, which reported the issue to Google, these tokens can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, and Google Drive. The security company says one million Google accounts have been compromised this way since August, in what it believes is the largest Google account breach to date. Google users can use Check Point's Gooligan-checker to see if their account has been compromised. Rather than use those tokens to steal information, Gooligan-infected devices are designed to go about fraudulently earning their operators ad revenue. Check Point estimates that two million apps have been installed this way over the past three months. These apps earn attackers money in two ways: each app install results in a payment to the attacker, while apps also earn revenue from ad services that pay to distribute ads through installed apps. To feed the scheme, the malware also forces infected devices to leave positive reviews and a high rating on Google Play. Android security lead Adrian Ludwig said in a blog that Google had found no evidence that the user data has been accessed, adding that the main objective of the malware, which is a variant of the already known <e1>Ghost Pus</e1>h, is to promote apps rather than steal information.

[CLS] New <e2>TangleBot</e2> malware is targeting Android devices in the US and Canada A cyber security company, Proofpoint/Cloudmark has recently identified a new threat that can take over the victim’s mobile phone through SMS. The threat has been found in the United States and in Canada and as per the reports, Android users are the main target of this malware. This security threat has been named as the <e1>Tangle Bot</e1> due to its ability to takeover a number of device’s functions that may include contact list, phone history, camera and microphone along with the ability to use Internet.

[CLS] Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as <e1>Frozen Cell</e1>, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the <e2>Fatah</e2> political party.

[CLS] TangleBot: New text message-based malware capable of defrauding Android users The Nigerian Communications Commission (<e1>NCC</e1>) recently announced the existence of a new high-risk, a critical and short messaging service-based malware named TangleBot. In a press statement released by the commission, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, Director of Public Affairs, explained that TangleBot only infects Android mobile devices. He added that: “The disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission’s <e2>New Media and Information Security Department</e2> by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT).

[CLS] Citizen Lab didn’t release technical details of the zero-day, but did say that the “imagent” process (part of a built-in <e1>Apple</e1> app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for one of Pegasus’ launch routines, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime messages or notifications. Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV. “Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,” according to Citizen Lab. KISMET likely doesn’t work against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections, Citizen Labs noted. Apple meanwhile is looking into the issue. Inside One Victim’s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. “While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,” according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions – a highly unusual activity, the firm said. Those cloud connections resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, France, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, <e2>Choopa</e2>, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. [SEP]
[CLS] Distribution As a rented Trojan, Anubis was distributed using a wide range of delivery techniques: Google <e2>Play</e2> campaigns: using self-made or rented droppers actors were able to bypass Google Play security mechanisms and spread the Trojan using the official app store, potentially infecting thousands of victims at a time. Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly. Therefore the statement “only download apps from the official app store” is not enough to remain safe from malware. Recent updates The rental of <e1>Anubis 2</e1> was open from Q4 2017 until February 2019. [SEP]
[CLS] Exodus came to light when last month security researchers from <e1>Security Without Borders</e1> found the spyware hidden inside an app uploaded on the Play Store, targeted at the customers of a local <e2>Italian internet service provider (ISP)</e2>. They said the spyware was capable of rooting Android devices and possessed an advanced set of spying features that gave attackers full control of infected devices. [SEP]
[CLS] The immediate consequence to this, is that <e1>TangleBot</e1> gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications. The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things. Furthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the Android operating system. The NCC, therefore, wishes to, once again, urge millions of telecom consumers in Nigeria to be wary of such wiles of cyber criminals, whose intent is to defraud unsuspecting Internet users. In order to ensure maximum protection for Internet users in the country, the ngCERT has offered a number of preventive measures to be taken by the consumers. These measures include an advisory to telecom consumers and other Internet users to refrain from opening Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) from unknown sources while using your mobile devices. Additionally, telecom consumers should never respond or send reply to messages or call back a phone number that is associated with the text that they are unaware of. Should any telecom consumer or Internet user become curious and wish to ascertain the authenticity of any call or messages and wish to probe the incident, such persons may do a web search of both the number and the message content. The NCC hereby reiterates that mobile users are under obligation to practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact. Indeed, it is important to be judicious when downloading apps by reading install prompts closely, looking out for information regarding rights and privileges that the app may request. Other risk-mitigating measures advised by ngCERT is for users to be cautious of procuring any software from outside a certified <e2>app store</e2>. Advisedly, it is safer to call the company directly rather than using the phone number on the message received, especially if the message is spoofing a company. [SEP]

[CLS] This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by <e1>Cerberus</e1> to give itself more permissions without user interaction. Having control of the Accessibility Services, the malware proceeds to ensure its persistence in different ways, either by disabling Play Protect or by removing itself from the applications in use. On the other hand, Cerberus is capable of generating an instance of TeamViewer on mobile, and through the aforementioned Accessibility permissions, authorizing said session while the equipment is in use, all without user interaction. From that point, and as soon as the C2 server has the computer’s data, the rest of the functionalities are available to the attackers remotely. Abusing both the Accessibility Service and the TeamViewer session, Cerberus is capable of a lot. Its possibilities include: A keylogger Listing, retrieval, sending and forwarding of SMS Forwarding or transferring calls Installation and deletion of apps Locking and unlocking the screen (without user interaction) Collection of device data List of device applications Device file collection and extraction Phishing attacks via preloaded overlays Various protection capabilities, such as emulation detection The rocky history of Cerberus As we mentioned, Cerberus has been on the market for a long time, to the detriment of users and banks alike. However, there are two reasons why it is now a growing concern: on one hand, the rapid evolution of its functionalities and on the other, the release of its source code. Cerberus was born in 2019 as an espionage suite. While its design made it capable of bank fraud, at the time the malware lacked the level of sophistication required to steal two-step authentication (2FA) data from apps like Google Authenticator. However, a ThreatFabric report analyzed the second version of the malware in <e2>early 2020</e2>. Cerberus v2 was still in development by the same Eurasian team that brought it to life, with increasingly powerful functionality. [SEP]

[CLS] Until mid-2015, <e1>Rotexy</e1> used a plain-text JSON format to communicate with its C&C. The C&C address was specified in the code and was also unencrypted: In some versions, a dynamically generated low-level domain was used as an address: In its first communication, the Trojan sent the infected device’s IMEI to the C&C, and in return it received a set of rules for processing incoming SMSs (phone numbers, keywords and regular expressions) – these applied mainly to messages from banks, payment systems and mobile network operators. For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. Rotexy then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan’s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan’s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan’s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015–2016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format “/[number]” (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0–9999). In some samples, starting from <e2>January 2016</e2>, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. [SEP]

[CLS] The library that uses <e2>tinyML</e2> is not yet wired to the malware’s functionalities, but its presence in the malware code indicates the intention to do so in future variants. We will continue to monitor this ransomware family to ensure customers are protected and to share our findings and insights to the community for broad protection against these evolving mobile threats. Protecting organizations from threats across domains and platforms Mobile threats continue to rapidly evolve, with attackers continuously attempting to sidestep technological barriers and creatively find ways to accomplish their goal, whether financial gain or finding an entry point to broader network compromise. This new mobile ransomware variant is an important discovery because the malware exhibits behaviors that have not been seen before and could open doors for other malware to follow. It reinforces the need for comprehensive defense powered by broad visibility into attack surfaces as well as domain experts who track the threat landscape and uncover notable threats that might be hiding amidst massive threat data and signals. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android, now generally available, extends Microsoft’s industry-leading endpoint protection to Android.

[CLS] In addition, <e2>Monokle</e2> has the ability to install trusted certificates which allow it to gain root access to the device. This allows the attackers to deploy unique capabilities in their quest to steal data. Much of this is achieved by exploiting accessibility services and tailoring them to steal data from third-party applications, as well as using the predictive-text dictionaries of the user to gain insight into the kinds of topic that interest them. The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode. "Monokle is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software," Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told ZDNet. "It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device." While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (<e1>STC</e1>), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. [SEP]

[CLS] Researchers from <e2>Threatfabric</e2> found in July a new Android banking trojan dubbed ERMAC that is almost fully based on the popular banking trojan Cerberus. The source code of Cerberus was released in September 2020 on underground hacking forums after its operators failed an auction. According to the experts, ERMAC is operated by threat actors behind the BlackRock mobile malware. On August 17, two forum members named “ermac” and “DukeEugene” started advertising the malware. “DukeEugene”, posted the following message in his account: “Android botnet ERMAC. I will rent a new android botnet with wide functionality to a narrow circle of people (10 people). 3k$ per month. Details in PM.” DukeEugene is threat actor known to be behind the BlackRock banking Trojan. ERMAC differs from Cerberus in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm. “Despite the usage of different obfuscation techniques and new method of string encryption – using Blowfish encryption algorithm, we can definitely state that ERMAC is another Cerberus-based trojan.” reads the analysis published by Threatfabric. “Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts. clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device At the time of writing, <e1>ThreatFabric</e1> researchers with the help of support @malwrhunterteam experts determine that ERMAC is only targeting Poland, where is being distributed under the guise of delivery service and government applications.

X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster’s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. IBM X-Force reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. Malicious apps are a blight that both store operators and developers work hard to limit. Still, it is a recurring problem: In 2017, X-Force mobile researchers reported numerous occasions on which financial malware had sneaked into the Google Play Store, with the <e1>BankBot</e1> Android malware family leading the pack.

[CLS] <e1>Anubis</e1> now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. The majority of which appear to be Turkish, according to the language settings used by social media accounts sending commands. Once commands have been accepted, Anubis can hijack devices, steal data, and send information to command-and-control (C2) servers which have spread worldwide. The new variants are also able to detect if they are running on virtual machines (VMs), a common way for researchers to safely unpack and analyze malware. In Anubis' case, this also includes Android emulators such as <e2>Genymotion</e2>. Anubis is not the only Android malware variant which is being constantly improved and refined by its developers.

[CLS] The first version of Project Spy (detected by <e1>Trend Micro</e1> as AndroidOS_SpyAgent.HRXB) had the following capabilities: Collect device and system information (i.e., IMEI, device ID, manufacturer, model and phone number), location information, contacts stored, and call logs Collect and send SMS Take pictures via the camera Upload recorded MP4 files Monitor calls Searching further, we also found another sample that could be the second version of Project Spy. This version appeared as Wabi Music, and copied a popular video-sharing social networking service as its backend login page. In this second version, the developer’s name listed was “concipit1248” in Google Play, and may have been active between May 2019 to February 2020. This app appears to have become unavailable on Google Play in March 2020. The second Project Spy version has similar capabilities to the first version, with the addition of the following: Stealing notification messages sent from WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram Abandoning the FTP mode of uploading the recorded images Aside from changing the app’s supposed function and look, the second and third versions’ codes had little differences. Potentially malicious iOS connection Using the codes and “Concipit1248” to check for more versions, we found two other apps in the App Store. Further analysis of the iOS app “Concipit1248” showed that the server used, spy[.]cashnow[.]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of Project Spy. However, although the “Concipit1248” app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the “Concipit1248” app is still incubating.

[CLS] About 57% of these devices are located in Asia and about 9% are in <e2>Europe</e2>. In our research we identified tens of fake applications that were infected with this malware. If you’ve downloaded one of the apps listed in Appendix A, below, you might be infected. You may review your application list in “Settings -> Apps”, if you find one of this applications, please consider downloading an antivirus product such as Check Point ZoneAlarm to check if you are indeed infected. We have noticed that hundreds of the email addresses are associated with enterprise accounts worldwide. How do you know if your Google account is breached? You can check if your account is compromised by accessing the following web site that we created: https://gooligan.checkpoint.com/. If your account has been breached, the following steps are required: A clean installation of an operating system on your mobile device is required (a process called “flashing”). As this is a complex process, we recommend powering off your device and approaching a certified technician, or your mobile service provider, to request that your device be “re-flashed.” Change your Google account passwords immediately after this process. How do Android devices become infected? We found traces of the Gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, MonkeyTest, and <e1>Xinyinhe</e1>. By late 2015, the malware’s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes.

[CLS] TrickBot Pushing a 2FA Bypass App to Bank Customers in <e2>Germany</e2> IBM X-Force researchers analyzed an Android malware app that’s likely being pushed to infected users by the TrickBot Trojan. This app, dubbed “TrickMo” by our team, is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction. While it’s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app. According to our research, TrickMo is still under active development as we expect to see frequent changes and updates. While it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region, at this time, we are seeing it deployed specifically in Germany. Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016. In 2020, it appears that TrickBot’s vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts. First Signs in September 2019 In September 2019, a tweet by CERT-Bund caught the attention of the IBM Trusteer Mobile Security Research team. The tweet stated that TrickBot, a well-known banking Trojan owned by an organized cybercrime gang, uses man-in-the-browser (MITB) web injects in online banking sessions to ask infected users for their mobile phone number and device type. Machine translation of this tweet reads: “Watch out for online banking: <e1>Emotet</e1> reloads TrickBot. [SEP]

[CLS] Similarly to another Android spyware made in Italy, originally discovered by Lukas Stefanko and later named <e2>Skygofree</e2> and analyzed in depth by Kaspersky Labs, Exodus also takes advantage of "protectedapps", a feature in Huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications. By manipulating a SQLite database, Exodus is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption. Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in <e1>mike.jar,</e1> some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges.

[CLS] Millions of <e1>Google</e1> accounts have been compromised in a new attack campaign that uses Android credentials to access data from Google services. The Gooligan malware is downloaded to smartphone devices through third-party app stores, security firm <e2>Check Point</e2> found. [SEP]
[CLS] Customers of Chase, Wells Fargo, <e1>Bank of America</e1> and Capital One, along with nearly 400 other financial institutions, are being targeted by a malicious app disguised to look like the official account management platform for French telecom company Orange S.A. Researchers say this is just the beginning. Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan Anubis – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at Lookout warned in a new report. And it’s not just customers of big banks at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted. Infosec Insiders Newsletter “As a banking trojan malware, Anubis’ goal is to collect significant data about the victim from their mobile device for financial gain,” the Lookout report said. “This is done by intercepting SMSs, keylogging, file exfiltration, screen monitoring, GPS data collection and abuse of the device’s accessibility services.” The malicious version of the Orange Telecom account management app was submitted to the Google Play store in July 2021 and later removed, but the researchers warned that they believe this campaign was just a test of <e2>Google</e2>’s antivirus protections and will likely resurface soon.

[CLS] But new data published today by Citizen Lab researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the Pegasus spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the <e2>US</e2>, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place. Citizen Lab says ten of these 36 groups appear to be conducting surveillance in multiple countries and have not limited their spying inside their own country's borders, an act that may violate surveillance laws active in the states where Pegasus victims may be located. Citizen Lab researchers admitted that some of their findings may be inaccurate, as some targets may using VPN and satellite connections that may place their location in another country. But they also say this doesn't rule out that some Pegasus operators may be spying on dissidents living abroad, even in Western and well-developed countries where cross-border surveillance against their own citizens is strictly forbidden. In a statement provided to Citizen Lab researchers before the publication of today's report, an NSO Group spokesperson denied that the company was breaking any software export laws, adhering to the previously stated dogma that they're only selling Pegasus for crime-fighting purposes. "Contrary to statements made by [Citizen Lab], our product is licensed to government and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investigating and preventing crime and terror. Our business is conducted in strict compliance with applicable export control laws." To this statement, Citizen Lab responded with their own, pointing out that NSO Group, even after three years, continues to fail to see the reason the company is being heavily criticized online, and that's for selling Pegasus to oppressive regimes in the first place. "Citizen Lab research does not speak to what statements <e1>NSO</e1> may make during marketing, sales, or export compliance. [SEP]
[CLS] In August, it posed as fake “Adobe <e2>Flash</e2> Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after banking app users.

[CLS] The attack campaign, named Gooligan, breached the security of over one million <e2>Google</e2> accounts. The number continues to rise at an additional 13,000 breached devices each day. Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, Google Drive, and more. Gooligan is a new variant of the Android malware campaign found by our researchers in the SnapPea app last year. Check Point reached out to the Google Security team immediately with information on this campaign. Our researchers are working closely with Google to investigate the source of the Gooligan campaign. “We’re appreciative of both Check Point’s research and their partnership as we’ve worked together to understand these issues,” said Adrian Ludwig, Google’s director of Android security. “As part of our ongoing efforts to protect users from the <e1>Ghost Push</e1> family of malware, we’ve taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the Android ecosystem overall.

[CLS] According to <e2>BleepingComputer</e2>, the latest version of Anubis targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a keylogger login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device. The newest Anubis acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the fake Orange app is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including <e1>Bank of America</e1>, U. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware did not allow any <e2>Sber Bank</e2> apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number "11" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 campuphome[.]com 9 8 wewelowertick[.]com 3 9 bigslogous[.]com 25 10 zavannerweb[.]com 55 Conclusion A new and improved <e1>RuMMS</e1> is back in full force as RuMMS v2.

[CLS] Figure 7 lists the IP addresses of these C2 servers, the number of <e1>RuMMS</e1> apps that connect to each of them, and the example URL used as the first parameter of the HttpPost operation (used in the code of Figure 3). This indicates that multiple C2 servers were used in this campaign, but one (37.1.207.31) was the most heavily used. Figure 8 shows how these samples, C2 servers and hosting websites are related to each other, including when they were compiled or observed. In the quadrant, the smaller boxes in blue-gray represent particular apps in the RuMMS family, while the bigger boxes in deep-blue represent C2 servers used by some RuMMS apps. The dotted arrows represent the use of a particular C2 server by a specific app to send information and fetch instructions. In this figure we have 11 RuMMS samples, all of which were hosted on the website as shown in the “y” axis. The dates on the “x” axis show the dates when we first saw these apps in the wild. This figure demonstrates the following interesting information: The time range when threat actors distributed RuMMS on those shared-hosting websites is from January 2016 to March 2016. Threat actors used different websites to host different payloads at different times. This kind of “moving target” behavior made it harder to track their actions. The same websites have hosted different RuMMS samples at different dates. C2 servers are shared by multiple samples. This matches our observations of C2 servers as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8. RuMMS samples, hosting sites, C2 servers from Jan. 2016 to Mar. 2016 We do not know exactly how many people have been infected with RuMMS malware; however, our data suggests that there are at least 2,729 infections with RuMMS samples from January 2016 to early April 2016. Figure 9 shows the number of RuMMS infections recorded in the last four months. When we first observed the malware in <e2>January</e2>, we recorded 380 infections. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>TrickBot</e1> Mobile App Bypasses 2‐Factor Authentication for Net Banking Services The malware authors behind TrickBot banking Trojan have developed a new Android app that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to Internet banking customers via SMS or relatively more secure push notifications, and complete fraudulent transactions. The Android app, called "TrickMo" by IBM X-Force researchers, is under active development and has exclusively targeted German users whose desktops have been previously infected with the TrickBot malware. "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," IBM researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by Zeus cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication. The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious Ryuk ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials. Abusing Android's <e2>Accessibility Features</e2> to Hijack OTP Codes Initially spotted by the CERT-Bund last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices.

The WhatsApp breach was a notable example of a “zero click zero day,” in that it was able to infect a targeted device simply by sending a link to it that didn’t even need to be clicked to deliver its malware payload. NSO Group did not deny that it was behind the attack and the Department of Justice is investigating, according to the Times. NSO Group has consistently denied that it sells its products to governments for the purpose of anything but legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations.

A spokesperson for the U.K.'s National Crime Agency confirmed to Newsweek that the arrests were made by officers from the national cybercrime unit and that a number of digital devices were seized from the property. The suspect has now been released on bail. DroidJack has a large potential victim base—there are reportedly more than one billion Android users across the world. Android recorded a market share of 82.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, almost six times the size of the user base of Apple's iOS mobile system. Newsweek spoke to Sean Sullivan, security adviser at international online security company F-Secure, about the malware and how Android users can protect themselves. What is DroidJack? In cybersecurity parlance, DroidJack is known as a remote access tool, or RAT. Such tools allow the administrators of large computer networks to obtain access to individual devices from a remote location. However, when they are used maliciously to spy or obtain personal data, they are often referred to as remote access trojans. DroidJack is available to buy on the internet: the software's site, droidjack.net, advertises a lifetime package of the software for $210. Newsweek reached out to the software's founder, who named only as <e1>Sanjeevi</e1> and is based in India, about the purpose of the software. [SEP]

[CLS] “Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in <e2>Palestine</e2> and has also been highlighted by other researchers,” they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-23. Also, the C&C infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families. “The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the Google Play Store, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like Pegasus or <e1>FinFisher</e1>,” the researchers pointed out.

[CLS] In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we’ve also seen in a different malware family like <e2>FakeSpy</e2> also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

[CLS] 'Pegasus' iOS malware package also found to impact OS X, Apple issues patch Apple in a patch last week blocked a particularly nasty malware package called "<e2>Pegasus</e2>" from infiltrating iOS devices, and the company is now doing the same for its OS X desktop operating system. Apple on Thursday issued security updates for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Safari to address a vulnerability that potentially allows nefarious agents to take over a target device with a single click. Dubbed "Pegasus," the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more. Apple patched the vulnerability last week when it released iOS 9.3.5. It appears the same WebKit and kernel vulnerabilities that enable Pegasus to effectively infiltrate iOS devices also exist in OS X. To combat potential exposure, Apple issued a combined security update for OS X Yosemite and El Capitan, as well as a standalone fix for the Safari web browser. The combined OS X update includes the Safari patch. Pegasus was discovered by Citizen Lab and Lookout after a human rights activist was sent a link leading to a malicious webpage bearing the jailbreak and remote monitoring tools. An investigation into the malware revealed <e1>NSO</e1>, an Israeli-based organization owned by U. [SEP]
[CLS] Unique <e1>Monokle</e1> Android Spyware Self-Signs Certificates Researchers have linked the surveillance tool to a Russian tech firm that has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A never-before-publicized mobile spy tool, a mobile surveillanceware remote access trojan (RAT) for Android called Monokle, has been spotted using novel techniques to exfiltrate data. According to the Lookout researchers who discovered Monokle in the wild, the malware has the ability to self-sign trusted certificates to intercept encrypted SSL traffic. It can also record a phone’s lockscreen activity in order to obtain passcodes, and it can leverage <e2>accessibility services</e2> to gain access to third-party apps. [SEP]

[CLS] According to BleepingComputer, the latest version of <e1>Anubis</e1> targets nearly 400 apps and has the following functions: Records screen activity as well as audio from the microphone; Implements a SOCKS5 proxy for covert communication and package delivery; Captures screenshots; Sends mass text messages from the device to predefined receivers; Recovers contacts saved on the device; Sends, reads, deletes, and block notifications for SMS messages received by the device; Scans the device for files of interest to exfiltrate; Locks the device screen and shows a persistent ransom message; Submits USSD code requests to query bank balances; Captures GPS data and pedometer statistics; Implements a keylogger login information theft; Surveils active apps to imitate and execute overlay attacks; Stops malicious functionality and removes the virus from the device. The newest Anubis acts just like its previous variants meaning that it detects if the impacted device has Google Play Protected active and sends a bogus system warning to deceive the target into deactivating it. Following deactivation, the malware gains complete control of the device and is now able to send and receive data from the C2 without any interference. According to BleepingComputer, the fake Orange app is currently being distributed through malicious websites, direct messages on social media, smishing, and forum posts. According to Lookout’s threat researcher Kristina Balaam, this operation isn’t focusing only on French users of Orange S.A. but also on the American ones. While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, <e2>U.S. Bank</e2>, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust, and Wells Fargo.

[CLS] ViceLeaker Android spyware targets users in the Middle East Experts at <e2>Kaspersky</e2> have uncovered a spyware campaign dubbed ViceLeaker that spreads in the Middle East to spy on Android users. Kaspersky spotted a spyware campaign, tracked as ViceLeaker, that spreads in the Middle East to steal device and communications data from Android users. The ViceLeaker campaign has been active at least since May 2018 when it targeted dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. The same campaign was also monitored by researchers at Bitdefender that dubbed the malware Triout. The attack chain starts with malicious Telegram and WhatsApp messages containing links to Trojanized apps, one of which was a fake application named “Sex Game For Adults.” Attackers aim to backdoor legitimate applications with an unusual injection technique dubbed Smali. The mobile malware also aims to inject legitimate mobile applications with a backdoor for persistent access once it has compromised an Android device. “To backdoor legitimate applications, attackers used a Smali injection technique – a type of injection that allows attackers to disassemble the code of original app with the Baksmali tool, add their malicious code, and assemble it with Smali.” reads the analysis published by Kaspersky. “As a result, due to such an unusual compilation process, there were signs in the dex file that point to dexlib, a library used by the Smali tool to assemble dex files.” The ViceLeaker APK implements very common spyware features (exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs, and device information) along with backdoor capabilities (upload, download, delete files, camera takeover, and record surrounding audio). ViceLeaker leverages HTTP for C&C communications and to transfer exfiltrated data. During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source <e1>Jabber/XMPP</e1> called “Conversations. [SEP]
[CLS] The attacker behind the development of Anubis has been active for at least 12 years, and in order to stay current, has retooled the malware for use in fresh attack waves, <e1>Trend Micro</e1> researchers said on Monday. The Anubis banking Trojan is often found in social engineering and phishing campaigns, in which unwitting victims are lured to download malicious apps containing the malware. In total, 17,490 new samples of the malware have been found on two related servers by Trend Micro. Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, <e2>Italy</e2>, Germany, Australia, and Poland. [SEP]
[CLS] ” Special Technology Centre Ltd. (<e1>STC</e1>) has been sanctioned for interfering with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Monokle has been used in highly targeted attacks at least since March 2016, it supports a wide range of spying functionalities and implements advanced data exfiltration techniques. Monokle supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data. The list of functionalities implemented by the spyware includes: Track device location Get nearby cell tower info Retrieve accounts and associated passwords. Record audio and calls Suicide functionality and cleanup of staging files. Make screen recordings Keylogger and device-fingerprinting Retrieve browsing and call histories Take photos, videos, and screenshots Retrieve emails, SMSes, and Messages Steal contacts and calendar information Make calls and send text messages Execute arbitrary shell commands, as root, if root access is available The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, <e2>Skype</e2>, and Snapchat.

[CLS] Exodus: New Android Spyware Made in <e2>Italy</e2> Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named Exodus, which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two. We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victims are located in Italy. All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google. We believe this spyware platform is developed by an <e1>Italian company</e1> called eSurv, which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance. [SEP]
[CLS] The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, <e2>Azerbaijan</e2>, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as <e1>Dark Caracal</e1>, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer.

[CLS] A new variant of <e1>Cerberus</e1> banking trojan, called Alien, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America & Microsoft Outlook. The newly uncovered banking Alien trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials! When it has infected a device, the RAT tries to take passwords from at least 226 mobile applications; including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking & Capital One Mobile, as well as many collaboration & social apps e.g. Snapchat, Telegram & Microsoft Outlook. Underground Forums The malware, which was 1st advertised for rent on underground forums in Jan., has actively targeted institutions globally, including <e2>Australia</e2>, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the UK & the US.

[CLS] The app, named Dardesh, posed as a chat application and acted as a <e2>downloader</e2> for a second app that could spy on users. The Dardesh app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family Desert Scorpion. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. “The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,” the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed APT-C-23 to be behind this scheme. “Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers,” they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the <e1>FrozenCell</e1> family attributed to APT-C-23. [SEP]
[CLS] In addition, <e2>Monokle</e2> has the ability to install trusted certificates which allow it to gain root access to the device. This allows the attackers to deploy unique capabilities in their quest to steal data. Much of this is achieved by exploiting accessibility services and tailoring them to steal data from third-party applications, as well as using the predictive-text dictionaries of the user to gain insight into the kinds of topic that interest them. The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode. "Monokle is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software," Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told ZDNet. "It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device." While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery.

[CLS] Ginp Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details Counterfeit apps were found carrying a new version of the Android banking trojan called Ginp (detected by Trend Micro as <e2>AndroidOS_Ginp.HRXB</e2>) to steal user login credentials and credit card details. ThreatFabric’s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp’s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp’s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a "Google Play Verificator" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the <e1>Anubis</e1> malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Droidjack</e1> - Android developers gone rogue Android hackers love RATs. But not the grey furry creatures. They prefer cyber-RATs, cyber-crime tools that provide backdoor functionality and access to people’s mobile devices. Looking at the past six months, Bitdefender identified AndroRAT.A as a prevalent Android threat of 2015. Like other RATs, this detection allows a remote attacker to control the infected device with a user-friendly control panel – monitor and make phone calls and send SMS messages, get the device’s GPS coordinates, activate and use the camera and microphone and access files on the device. But if you’re looking to buy such a tool to spy on your wife or neighbor, think twice.

[CLS] The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, <e2>Switzerland</e2>, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the Android recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing.” One example of a message used in the latest FakeSpy campaign is an alert from the postal service local to the region of the victim, informing them that the service tried to send a package, but the receiver was not at home, for instance. Then, “the link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK),” according to a report on the campaign, by Ofir Almkias, mobile analyst with Cybereason. That APK downloads an app that appears to be from the local region’s legitimate postal service—such as the United States Postal Service (USPS)–but actually executes FakeSpy, an infostealer that requests permissions to take over SMS messages and steal sensitive data on devices. The malware, which has been a threat since 2017, also can access and use a target device’s contact list to infect other devices. Researchers believe that Chinese-speaking group known as “Roaming Mantis” is behind the campaign. Disguising malware as a legitimate mobile app is a hallmark of Roaming Mantis. The last major campaign from the threat group was seen two years ago with a banking trojan disguised as Google or Chrome that also targeted Android device users around the globe. Researchers analyzed code from a campaign in April 2020 that downloaded the <e1>Fakespy</e1> version impersonating Taiwan’s Chungwha Post app. [SEP]
[CLS] Names like Anubis, <e1>Hydra</e1>, Ginp, or Gustuff appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. However, the one that has dominated the arena this year –for several reasons– is Cerberus: a nightmare-inducing rodent. Cerberus, the king of all RATs Cerberus is a highly sophisticated Android malware, in circulation since 2019. It has been actively distributed on dark web forums, in a “malware-as-a-service” (MaaS) format. For a sum between $4,000 and $12,000, cybercriminal groups capable of paying it have had all the malware tools at their disposal. And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. Cerberus was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing Anubis’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the <e2>banking apps</e2> inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. [SEP]
[CLS] It was removed after <e1>Lookout</e1> notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party. <e2>Palestine</e2> is a lightning rod of political controversy both around the world and domestically, as the territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have played host to an ongoing and deadly clash between Hamas and Fatah.

[CLS] Researchers from <e2>Palo Alto Networks</e2> said DualToy has been in existence since January 2015, and it originally was limited to installing unwanted apps and displaying mobile ads on Android devices. About six months later, the Trojan morphed and began targeting iOS devices by installing a third-party App Store in hopes of nabbing iTunes usernames and passwords. “When DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android devices… We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015. Later in 2016, a new variant appeared,” wrote senior malware researcher Claud Xiao in a technical description of the Trojan. Researchers said once DualToy infects a Windows machine, it looks for the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes, and downloads drivers for both if they’re missing in order to infect mobile devices once connected. “Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms,” Xiao wrote. Researchers say they have observed 8,000 unique samples of the DualToy variant to date, and add they can’t be sure how many mobile devices have been infected by the malware. Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… <e1>WireLurker</e1> installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones.

[CLS] A “cyber arms dealer” named <e1>NSO Group</e1> developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets. Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, <e2>Kakao</e2> Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.

[CLS] Most infections (40 per cent) are in Asia, though 19 per cent are in the Americas, most of which are in North America, <e2>Shaulov</e2> said. Another 12 per cent are based in Europe. Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind <e1>HummingBad</e1> made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. [SEP]

[CLS] Report: NSO Group's Pegasus Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the <e2>Financial Times</e2> on Friday. According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history. The paper wrote that the documents advertise the functionality as allowing ongoing access to data stored on the servers of tech giants that persists beyond the Pegasus infection on the phone itself (presumably until the authentication key in question is invalidated): It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone. One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”. The documents brag that having access to a “cloud endpoint” allows access “far and above smartphone content,” the Times wrote. Amazon said there was no evidence its servers had been breached, as did Google, according to the paper. Facebook said it was reviewing the claims, while Microsoft said its security tools are “continually evolving” and Apple noted that while “expensive tools may exist to perform targeted attacks,” it does “not believe these are useful for widespread attacks against consumers.” An <e1>NSO Group</e1> spokesperson told the Times that “We do not provide or market any type of hacking or mass-collection capabilities to any cloud applications, services or infrastructure,” though it did not deny having developed the functionality.

The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it’s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, <e2>Asia</e2> and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation.

[CLS] 0 (Detected by <e1>Trend Micro</e1> as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both Android and Flash Player. Once a user downloads one of these malicious apps into their devices and opens it, a popup overlay will appear prompting the user to enter their login credentials. The credentials are then sent to a Command and Control (C&C server) that the attackers control. Red Alert 2.0 will block incoming calls from banks, presumably to block verification attempts. The malware also intercepts SMS text messages, sending messages to the attackers for future use. By disrupting the device’s actual communication capabilities, the attackers can maximize the time spent doing malicious activities. According to its researchers, Red Alert 2.0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500—a low price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers. Red Alert 2.0 can target mobile devices that are running Android versions of up to 6.0, which was released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores. No versions of the malicious apps carrying the malware have been detected on the official <e2>Google</e2> Play Store as of the time of publication. [SEP]

[CLS] Cerberus: A New Android 'Banking Malware For Rent' Emerges August 13, 2019 After a few popular Android Trojans like <e2>Anubis</e2>, Red Alert 2.0, GM bot, and <e1>Exobot</e1>, quit their malware-as-a-service businesses, a new player has emerged on the Internet with similar capabilities to fill the gap, offering Android bot rental service to the masses. [SEP]
[CLS] With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada <e2>China</e2> Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.K. U.S. While there were 10 downloader apps in the Google Play Store at the time of this writing, the campaign is rather hefty. <e1>X-Force</e1> estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. [SEP]
[CLS] That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving Cerberus and likely also led to this combined attack with the <e2>Ursnif</e2> banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that’s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won’t be able to continue to use their bank’s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone’s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as <e1>hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK</e1> BRAND].

[CLS] ” Newer features coming to <e1>Anubis</e1> banking trojan The Anubis banking malware operators are working on features that will give the attackers more insights into the infected devices. One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, <e2>banking apps</e2> belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.

[CLS] ” Targeting users in Germany at this time, <e1>TrickMo</e1> is the latest variation in the transaction authentication number (TAN)-stealing malware category. Its main capabilities include: Stealing personal device information Intercepting SMS messages Recording targeted applications for one-time password (TAN) Lockdown of the phone Stealing pictures from the device Self-destruction and removal As banks release more advanced security measures, banking malware evolves to keep up with the perpetual arms race. From our analysis of the TrickMo mobile malware, it is apparent that TrickMo is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in Germany. Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer <e2>pushTAN app</e2> validations used by German banks.

[CLS] 0, GM bot, and <e1>Exobot</e1>, quit their malware-as-a-service businesses, a new player has emerged on the Internet with similar capabilities to fill the gap, offering Android bot rental service to the masses. Dubbed "Cerberus," the new remote access Trojan allows remote attackers to take total control over the infected Android devices and also comes with banking Trojan capabilities like the use of overlay attacks, SMS control, and contact list harvesting. According to the author of this malware, who is surprisingly social on Twitter and mocks security researchers and <e2>antivirus</e2> industry openly, Cerberus has been coded from scratch and doesn't re-use any code from other existing banking Trojans.

[CLS] "Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016," <e2>IBM</e2> researchers said. "In 2020, it appears that TrickBot's vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts." The name TrickMo is a direct reference to a similar kind of Android banking malware called ZitMo that was developed by <e1>Zeus</e1> cybercriminal gang in 2011 to defeat SMS-based two-factor authentication.

[CLS] A, can’t be found on any official <e2>Android app store</e2> – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one. “Using Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” says Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. Malware that enslaves devices to form botnets needs to be able to receive updated instructions. That communication is an Achilles heel for any botnet – it may raise suspicion and, cutting the bots off is always lethal to the botnet’s functioning. Additionally, should the command-and-control (C&C) servers get seized by the authorities, it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet. To make the <e1>Twitoor</e1> botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks.

[CLS] Origins: It all started with BankBot In December <e2>2016</e2> the actor “maza-in” wrote an article named “Android BOT from scratch” in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed “Android.BankBot.149.origin”. Although being a generic name for banking malware, “BankBot” became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used <e1>Bankbot</e1> for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. [SEP]
[CLS] First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. <e2>Security Without Borders</e2> has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features. Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named Connexxa S.R.L. and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer’s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv’s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to <e1>eSurv S.R.L.</e1> on Feb 28, 2016. [SEP]
[CLS] This malware sold to governments could help them spy on iPhones, researchers say Many people assume their iPhones are secure, but new research sent <e1>Apple</e1> scrambling to fix vulnerabilities that left users at risk. Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaws in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. "This is the most sophisticated bad actor we have ever seen targeting mobile phones out in the wild," said Mike Murray, vice president of security research at Lookout. The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the <e2>U.S.</e2> private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. [SEP]
[CLS] More digging uncovered <e2>KISMET</e2>, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, <e1>Center-1</e1> and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively. [SEP]
[CLS] Enter an Israeli technology firm, <e1>NSO</e1> Group. The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone. Pegasus is designed to infiltrate devices running Android, Blackberry, iOS and Symbian operating systems and turn them into surveillance devices. The company says it sells Pegasus only to governments and only for the purposes of tracking criminals and terrorists. How it works Earlier version of Pegasus were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities in commonly used apps or by spear-phishing, which involves tricking a targeted user into clicking a link or opening a document that secretly installs the software. It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or manually if an agent can steal the target’s phone. Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app <e2>WhatsApp</e2> without the phone’s user noticing. [SEP]
[CLS] New malware seizes on COVID-19 to target Android users A new form of malware that experts are referring to as "<e1>TangleBot</e1>" is relying on interest in COVID-19 to trick Android users in the U.S and Canada into clicking on a link that will infect their cell phones, according to analysts at the mobile and email security company Cloudmark. Cloudmark says the "clever and complicated" malware sends Android users a text message claiming to have the latest COVID-19 guidance in their area or informs them that their third COVID-19 vaccine appointment has been scheduled. When users click on the link provided, they're prompted to update their phone's Adobe Flash player, which instead installs the virus on their phone, according to Cloudmark. Here's what such a text message might look like, according to Cloudmark: "Once that happens, the TangleBot malware can do a ton of different things," Ryan Kalember, executive vice president of cybersecurity at Cloudmark's parent company <e2>ProofPoint</e2>, told CBS News. [SEP]
[CLS] Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the <e2>Play Protect</e2> security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who’s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed APT-C-23 to be behind this scheme. “Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers,” they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-23. Also, the C&C infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families. “The approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the Google Play Store, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like <e1>Pegasus</e1> or FinFisher,” the researchers pointed out. [SEP]
[CLS] Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, <e2>Germany</e2>, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. The majority of which appear to be Turkish, according to the language settings used by social media accounts sending commands. Once commands have been accepted, Anubis can hijack devices, steal data, and send information to command-and-control (C2) servers which have spread worldwide. The new variants are also able to detect if they are running on virtual machines (VMs), a common way for researchers to safely unpack and analyze malware. In Anubis' case, this also includes Android emulators such as Genymotion. Anubis is not the only Android malware variant which is being constantly improved and refined by its developers. Last week, Fortinet researchers said <e1>BianLian</e1> -- which began life as a dropper for Anubis and is now an established banking Trojan on its own accord -- is now bypassing Google Android protections to propagate its malicious code.

[CLS] Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from <e2>WhatsApp</e2> Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware. The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. Connexxa is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. A Connexxa engineer who appears to own equity in the company also digitally signed some versions of Exodus. Connexxa’s appearance in the Apple-issued digital certificate, its role in the server infrastructure used by both Exodus and the iOS apps, and servers that hosted both Exodus and the iOS apps give researchers a high degree of confidence that both malware packages are the work of the same developers. Researchers said that a company called <e1>eSurv S.R.L</e1>. was also involved. [SEP]
[CLS] New <e2>Trojan</e2> SpyNote Installs Backdoor on Android Devices A new SpyNote Trojan can give bad guys control over your phone from the camera, microphone to eavesdropping on phone calls. A new Android Trojan called SpyNote has been identified by researchers who warn that attacks are forthcoming. The Trojan, found by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 team, has not been spotted in any active campaigns, but it is now widely available on the Dark Web and that it will soon be used in a wave of upcoming attacks. Unit 42 discovered the Trojan while monitoring malware discussion forums. Researchers say that’s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone’s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone’s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim’s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. <e1>Droidjack</e1> made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pokémon Go with the Trojan. [SEP]
[CLS] Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of <e1>Cerberus (v2)</e1> was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app. The code of that feature code is almost identical to that introduced with the Alien Trojan in February 2020. This indicates that at that time, the developer behind the Cerberus Trojan had access to, and might have been responsible for development of the Alien code. The code of the Google Authenticator 2FA stealer of the Alien Trojan is visible in following snippet: The Alien malware As described in previous sections, the Alien malware is a rented banking Trojan which offers more than the average capabilities of Android banking Trojans. It has common capabilities such as overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages and harvest the contact list. It can leverage its <e2>keylogger</e2> for any use and therefore broaden the attack scope further than its target list. [SEP]
[CLS] Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as <e1>Frozen Cell</e1>, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target’s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app’s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion’s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a “dropper” for malware pretending to be a settings application. “We’re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,” said Andrew Blaich, Lookout’s head of device intelligence. “Especially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn’t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.” Several of the malware’s package names include the word “Fateh” which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party. Palestine is a lightning rod of political controversy both around the world and domestically, as the territories of the West Bank and <e2>Gaza Strip</e2> have played host to an ongoing and deadly clash between Hamas and Fatah.

[CLS] This most recent FakeSpy campaign appears to target users of <e2>postal services</e2> around the world. New versions of FakeSpy masquerade as government post office apps and transportation services apps. Our analysis indicates that the threat actors are no longer limiting their campaigns to East Asian countries, but are targeting additional countries around the world. THREAT ANALYSIS Infection Vector: Smishing Your Device Thus far, FakeSpy campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a. smishing). These SMS messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the FakeSpy download. In a previous campaign reported by JPCERT, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “delivery updates” purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company. For most of its history it operated as a government department or public corporation. <e1>Deutsche Post</e1> - Deutsche Post DHL Group, a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn.

[CLS] <e1>Anubis</e1> Strikes Again: Mobile Malware Continues to Plague Users in Official App Stores IBM X-Force mobile malware researchers have observed several developers actively uploading Android malware downloaders to the Google Play Store. Following ongoing campaigns against Google Play, our research team has been monitoring <e2>banking malware</e2> activity in official app stores. [SEP]
[CLS] Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the <e2>Apple App</e2> certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. “This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver. [SEP]
[CLS] A RAT is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a <e2>trojan</e2> horse program, and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software and other anti-virus software. A RAT enables its operators to perform many activities on the compromised device (e.g. control a device's camera, access its storage, intercept calls and text messages, etc.). This is all done via an easy-to-use application hosted on a command and control server. Executive summary A sample Android application was chosen for analysis from a pool of 71 malicious ones reported by Lookout’s research. The sample examined is an instance of the <e1>SpyNote RAT</e1>. After the application is installed, it is displayed as Android with the icon resembling the one of the built-in Android applications Settings. [SEP]
[CLS] The list of these original features is very limited compared to recent banking Trojans but enough to steal personal information from the victims: Overlaying: Dynamic - C2 based (possibility to remotely modify the list of targeted application) SMS blocking (hiding messages from the victim) SMS sending (capability to send messages from the infected device) SMS harvesting (possibility to send a copy of all message to the C2 server) About <e2>Anubis</e2> Rise of <e1>maza-in</e1> By publishing the aforementioned article, maza-in earned himself a reputation of Android expert on underground forums. [SEP]
[CLS] The infrastructure used included servers in <e2>Germany</e2>, France, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. “Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation…we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked,” researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.” The firm believes with “medium confidence” that <e1>Sneaky Kestrel</e1> acts on behalf of the UAE.

[CLS] We found traces of the <e1>Gooligan</e1> malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren’t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan’s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, <e2>MonkeyTest</e2>, and Xinyinhe. [SEP]
[CLS] After that, <e1>DualToy</e1> will execute “msiexec.exe” to install the installers shown in Figure 8 in background via the “/qn” parameter. Operate iOS devices In order to operate iOS devices through installed iTunes drivers, DualToy reused an open source project “iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport”. Using this, DualToy invokes APIs in iTunes’ iTunesMobileDevice.dll file via reflection, so that it can interact with iOS devices just like iTunes does. DualToy will watch for USB connections. Once there’s a valid iOS device connected, it will try to connect to it using iTunes APIs. Like Android, Apple also introduced manual user authorization starting with iOS 7 to prevent sideloading. As it does with Android devices, DualToy will check whether the iOS device was previously paired so that it can reuse existing pairing record (Figure 10). Steal iOS device information After successfully connecting with an iOS device, DualToy will collect device and system information, encrypt them and send to its C2 server. The collected information includes: Device name, type, version and model number Device UUID and serial number Device baseband version, system build version, and firmware version Device IMEI SIM card’s IMSI and ICCID Phone number Download and install app In addition to collecting device information, DualToy also tries to download IPA file(s) from the C2 server and install them on the connected iOS device. The URL it used to fetch the downloading list is http://www.zaccl[.]com/tool/apple/wj_app.xml. During our analysis in April and in <e2>August 2016</e2>, this URL always returned a single file, “kuaiyong. [SEP]
[CLS] For example: WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to steal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices The HackingTeam’s <e1>RCS</e1> delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection. When DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android devices. However, within six months the malicious actors added the capability to infect iOS devices. DualToy is still active and we have detected over 8,000 unique samples belonging to this Trojan family to date. It mainly targets Chinese users, but has also successfully affected people and organizations in the <e2>United States</e2>, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain, and Ireland. [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in <e2>Mexico</e2> who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of <e1>National Security Agency</e1> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. [SEP]
[CLS] On December 13 2018 maza-in announces the release of <e1>Anubis 2.5</e1>; seemingly only redesigning the backend web interface, while actually stating that he rewrote the whole bot code. On January 16 2019 Anubis code is leaked in an underground forum (both backend code and unobfuscated APK). On February 14 2019 for the first time an Anubis sample seen targeting Russian banks only is spotted (indicating a new campaign / new operator). On February 25 2019 some complaints from Anubis customers appear in underground forums stating that maza-in and Anubis support no longer reply to messages. On March 04 2019, the admin of one underground forum states maza-in got arrested. Shortly after this, accounts of maza-in are banned on multiple forums. During March 2019, actor Aldesa (who shares a connection with maza-in) creates a post to sell the so-called “<e2>Anubis 3</e2>” malware on an underground forum. [SEP]

[CLS] The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising "secrets" about prisoners tortured in United Arab Emirates jails. <e2>Mansoor</e2> was almost immediately suspicious, he said. He has been jailed for his activism and targeted with commercial malware in past incidents that researchers have linked to the UAE government. “I’m a regular target for the authorities here,” he told The Post. “Every time they get new spyware, they seem to try it out on me.” So instead of clicking the links in the text messages, he sent them to researchers at Citizen Lab. Working with Lookout, they confirmed his fears: Mansoor’s attackers would have been able to essentially take over his phone if he'd clicked. The UAE did not immediately respond to a Post request for comment. One brochure for the <e1>NSO Group</e1> advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed Pegasus, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands. [SEP]
[CLS] One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows “remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.” But Citizen Lab’s research suggests that NSO Group’s spying tools aren’t “untraceable.” The researchers were able to track a network of sites hosting the malware, some that used web addresses designed to trick users into thinking they are legitimate sites. In another case cited in the Citizen Lab report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country’s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers.

The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists. And as the recent leak of National Security Agency hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. Governments and companies such as the NSO Group that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there’s no guarantee others won’t discover the same problems, some say. “Government use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,” said <e2>Chris Soghoian</e2>, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers also noticed that the posts published by the hacker were using poor English. <e1>mobeebom</e1> has been promoting the MobiHok RAT through multiple channels, including YouTube and a dedicated Facebook page, since January 2019. MobiHok is written in Visual Basic .NET and Android Studio, it allows to fully control the infected device. Experts pointed out that the latest release of the RAT implements new features, including a bypass to the Facebook authentication mechanism. The analysis conducted by the experts suggests that the threat actor obtained SpyNote’s source code and made some minor changes to its code before reselling it online. “However, from a research we conducted into mobeebom’s activity in the underground communities, and the analysis of a sample of the malware builder we retrieved, it is apparent that the threat actor based MobiHok on the source code of another prominent Android RAT named SpyNote, which was leaked online in 2016.” continues the report. “The initial findings of our technical analysis confirmed that mobeebom probably obtained SpyNote’s source code, made some minor changes, and now resells it as a new RAT under the name MobiHok.” In July 2016, experts from Palo Alto Networks a RAT offered for free called Spynote, much like OmniRat and DroidJack, today the malware can be purchased from a website on the surface web, or downloaded for free from a forum. MobiHok supports several features, including access to files, access to the camera, keylogging, control over SMS and contacts, the ability to bypass both Samsung security mechanisms and Google Play mechanisms, and to bind itself to another APK app. “To conclude, despite mobeebom’s attempt to market his MobiHok v4 Android RAT as new and his declared intention to make it the top Android RAT on the market, it appears that this malware is based on the leaked source code of the known SpyNote Android RAT with only minor changes and is being reselled by the threat actor under a different name.” concludes <e2>Sensecy</e2>.

[CLS] Gooligan is a new variant of the Android malware campaign found by our researchers in the SnapPea app last year. <e2>Check Point</e2> reached out to the Google Security team immediately with information on this campaign. Our researchers are working closely with Google to investigate the source of the Gooligan campaign. “We’re appreciative of both Check Point’s research and their partnership as we’ve worked together to understand these issues,” said Adrian Ludwig, Google’s director of Android security. “As part of our ongoing efforts to protect users from the <e1>Ghost Push</e1> family of malware, we’ve taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the Android ecosystem overall.

[CLS] Customers of Chase, Wells Fargo, <e2>Bank of America</e2> and Capital One, along with nearly 400 other financial institutions, are being targeted by a malicious app disguised to look like the official account management platform for French telecom company Orange S.A. Researchers say this is just the beginning. Once downloaded, the malware – a variant of banking trojan Anubis – steals the user’s personal data to rip them off, researchers at Lookout warned in a new report. And it’s not just customers of big banks at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted. <e1>Infosec</e1> Insiders Newsletter “As a banking trojan malware, Anubis’ goal is to collect significant data about the victim from their mobile device for financial gain,” the Lookout report said.

[CLS] Here are some of the features of RCSAndroid include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, <e1>WeChat</e1>, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger. RCSAndroid Android hacking tool had been in the wild since 2012 and has been known to Citizen Lab researchers since last year when the security firm detailed a Hacking Team backdoor used against Android users in Saudi Arabia. How RCSAndroid hacking tool infects a Target? RCSAndroid uses two different methods to infect targeted Android devices. 1. Hacking Team used text and email messages containing specially crafted URLs that triggered exploits for several vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-2825 and <e2>CVE-2012-2871</e2>) present in the default browsers of Android 4.

[CLS] Yes, this time researchers have found a source code to a new piece of weaponized android malware that had the capability to infect millions of Android devices even when users are running latest versions of the android mobile operating system. <e2>Trend Micro</e2> researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling RCSAndroid (Remote Control System Android), which they says, is one of the "most professionally developed and sophisticated" pieces of Android malware a.k.a Android hacking tool they have ever seen. RCSAndroid is a sophisticated, real-world surveillance and hacking tool that provides even unskilled hackers to deploy one of the world's more advanced surveillance suites for Google's mobile operating system Android. List of Creepy Features of Android Hacking Tool Once installed on targets' devices, RCSAndroid would have helped government and law enforcement agencies around the world to completely compromise and monitor Android devices remotely. Here are some of the features of RCSAndroid include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger.

[CLS] At the end of July, because of these issues, the actor behind <e1>Cerberus</e1> tried to sell the service, including the customer portfolio, in the hopes another actor would continue his work. Our telemetry, as seen in the graph below, shows a steady decrease of new Cerberus samples starting from this moment. After a series of customer complaints and due to his fruitless attempts to sell the source code of the Trojan as a whole, the owner of the malware finally decided to end the rental service and refund active license holders. On August 10th 2020 he shared the source code of Cerberus with the administrator of the underground forum in which he was renting it out. As we forecasted, shortly after, the source code of the Trojan became available to the general public. You might wonder why the number of samples drops and barely increases again despite the source code being publicly available. There are two reasons: firstly, actors who got their hands on the code need to understand how to setup the backend (C2) and builder, secondly the actors which successfully built samples noticed that their payload is immediately detected by Play Protect when installed on an Android device and therefore are now probably working on rearranging the code (resulting in their own code fork). All samples detected since the official Cerberus service interruption are test samples and no large-scale or successful campaign has been observed so far. However, since Cerberus was such a successful malware, it is likely that other actors will start using it actively once its issues are resolved, therefore we can expect it to resurface at any time. Despite Cerberus not being actively rented and supported any longer, we still often see some researchers reporting active Cerberus campaigns. To explain why this happens we decided to write this blog and clear up any confusion: currently reported campaigns can be attributed to a fork of Cerberus, called “Alien”. Behind the scenes Our story starts on <e2>January 2020</e2>, when our analyst team first spotted something which at first glance could have been considered a new version of Cerberus. [SEP]
[CLS] Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in <e2>Google Play Protect</e2>. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named <e1>FrozenCell</e1> - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. [SEP]
[CLS] While we can’t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting US banks including Bank of America, <e2>U.S. Bank</e2>, Capital One, Chase, <e1>SunTrust</e1>, and Wells Fargo. [SEP]
[CLS] The team recently reported that <e2>downloader</e2> apps in the store are being used as the first step in an infection routine that fetches the <e1>Marcher</e1> (aka Marcher ExoBot) and BankBot Anubis mobile banking Trojans. [SEP]

[CLS] The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the <e2>Caucasus</e2> region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. "In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware," said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to <e1>Special Technology Centre</e1> (STC), a Russian company working out of St Petersburg. [SEP]
[CLS] Hackers love targeting Android devices due to its open source model and <e2>Google</e2>’s weak bouncer system that lets malicious apps pass by on the official Play Store. Recently, security researchers at <e1>Palo Alto</e1>’s Unit 42 discovered a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allow attackers to gain remote administrative control of an infected device. [SEP]
[CLS] Once an application has been identified, <e1>Anubis</e1> overlays the original application with a fake login page to capture the user’s credentials. Based on a thorough analysis of the code, the most interesting technical capabilities include: Capturing screenshots Enabling or changing administration settings Opening and visiting any URL Disabling Play Protect Recording audio Making phone calls Stealing the contact list Controlling the device via VNC Sending, receiving and deleting SMS Locking the device Encrypting files on the device and external drives Searching for files Retrieving the GPS location Capturing remote control commands from Twitter and Telegram Pushing overlays Reading the device ID The malware includes a keylogger that works in every app installed on the Android device. However, the keylogger needs to be specifically enabled by a command sent from the C2 server. The keylogger can track three different events (Figure 5): TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED Represents the event of clicking on a View-like Button, CompoundButton, etc. TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED Represents the event of setting input focus of a View. TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED Represents the event of changing the text of an EditText. Figure 6 shows one of the most noteworthy functions of Anubis: its <e2>ransomware</e2> module. [SEP]
[CLS] By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the <e1>Anubis</e1> <e2>trojan</e2> source code. [SEP]
[CLS] Perhaps the malware’s most troubling capability, <e1>SpyNote</e1> allows the attacker to execute commands. “Command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim’s device. Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day,” Shivang Desai, a researcher with the firm wrote Tuesday. When it comes to surveillance, the RAT can take screen captures – and by taking advantage of the way the device handles audio – record conversations. According to researchers the malware hijacks the MediaProjection.Callback API, something first introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop, to record audio. It saves the recorded content in a file, “video.mp4,” that can be sent back to the C2. Like other RATs, this version of SpyNote can also steal SMS messages and contacts from infected devices and funnel them back to the C2. The malware steals the contacts and writes them as a local array before they’re exfiltrated, Desai said. It also, for good measure, collects the device’s location and sends that along to attackers. While the RAT is sophisticated, there’s one catch, the firm claims. In order for the RAT to work, the infected device has to be connected to WiFi. That way it can transmit data and files to its C+C unfettered. It’s likely not the last we’ll hear about SpyNote in 2017, the firm claims, adding that researchers there uncovered a handful of copycat apps built with the same SpyNote malware builder. Apps designed to mimic Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, <e2>Super Mario Run</e2>, and Pokemon Go are all making the rounds in the hacking community. [SEP]

You can check if your account is compromised by accessing the following web site that we created: https://gooligan.checkpoint.com/. If your account has been breached, the following steps are required: A clean installation of an operating system on your mobile device is required (a process called “flashing”). As this is a complex process, we recommend powering off your device and approaching a certified technician, or your mobile service provider, to request that your device be “re-flashed.” Change your Google account passwords immediately after this process.

[CLS] Lookout said there is "currently no evidence" the actor successfully deployed it against the <e1>Israeli Defense Force</e1> this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be "highly active" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of <e2>Google</e2>'s app store.

[CLS] Names like Anubis, Hydra, <e1>Ginp</e1>, or Gustuff appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. However, the one that has dominated the arena this year –for several reasons– is Cerberus: a nightmare-inducing rodent. Cerberus, the king of all RATs Cerberus is a highly sophisticated Android malware, in circulation since 2019. It has been actively distributed on dark web forums, in a “malware-as-a-service” (MaaS) format. For a sum between $4,000 and $12,000, cybercriminal groups capable of paying it have had all the malware tools at their disposal. And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. Cerberus was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing Anubis’s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the banking apps inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. Like any Remote Access Trojan worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside. Basically, Cerberus can intercept and steal your phone’s unlock pattern or PIN, as well as Google Authenticator numbers, and any SMS necessary to perform a two-step verification. Likewise, this malware can interpose itself between you and your bank’s app through an overlay, the most common method for carrying out a phishing attack. In short, Cerberus can enter your computer, extract all the necessary data to perform a bank fraud, and wait for the best moment to take the money from your account. All without you doing anything. Cerberus and its complex functionality Regarding what Cerberus can do, it is necessary to point out two possibilities within its functionality. We already mentioned that Cerberus is a RAT, but to achieve such control of the phone, it is necessary to have control of a vulnerability. In this case, it is the <e2>Android Accessibility Service</e2>. This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by Cerberus to give itself more permissions without user interaction. [SEP]
[CLS] 11 El Capitan and <e1>Safari</e1> to address a vulnerability that potentially allows nefarious agents to take over a target device with a single click. Dubbed "Pegasus," the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits <e2>kernel flaws</e2> to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more.

[CLS] 0 Android Trojan that first came to light last year is being advertised on underground sites for anyone to rent. <e1>Red Alert</e1> is capable of stealing tons of sensitive information from infected mobile devices including SMS messages, contact details, information about WiFi networks, call logs, and data about current or recently running tasks. It can also initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm, block calls from banks and connect with bots via Twitter in case its command and control server (C&C) happens to go offline. Researchers said the malware has a UI to enable the device admin access, and does not allow the user to disable it once enabled. “The malware sets itself up as a default telephony provider, mostly for intercepting SMS messages,” researchers said. “A list of phone numbers to be intercepted can be controlled by the C&C server. Messages from these numbers may be hidden from the user. Intercepted messages are also sent to the C&C server. This could be used for intercepting 2 factor authentication codes used by most services these days including online banking.” Once the malware has full access to the infected device, it can even wipe out all data from the device. The malware is shipped via spam emails delivering .APK (Android Package Kit) attachments and it targets Android devices running Android marshmallow and later. Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, “Out of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.” Red Alerts 2.0 malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the U.S, U.K, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, India and Italy, according to researchers. It is also being advertised for rent on underground forums starting at $200 for a week, $500 for a month and $999 for two months. The developer behind Red Alert 2.0 also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, Viber, <e2>Skype</e2>, Uber and more.

[CLS] LESS-SOPHISTICATED EXODUS IOS VERSION ALSO DISCOVERED But in research published today and presented at the <e2>Kaspersky Security Analyst</e2> Summit conference, the team at Lookout said it discovered an iOS variant of this spyware during their analysis of Exodus samples they've found last year. "Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port," Lookout security researcher Adam Bauer said in a report published today. Bauer said the iOS version was being offered for download through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. The Exodus-infected iOS apps were signed with <e1>Apple</e1>-issued enterprise certificates, which allowed victims to install the malicious apps, even from outside the App Store. [SEP]
[CLS] From our analysis of the <e2>TrickMo</e2> mobile malware, it is apparent that TrickMo is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in Germany. Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks. In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a “kill switch” that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device. Why Do Desktop Trojans Use a Mobile Component? About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim’s online banking account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client’s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous <e1>Zeus</e1> Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ZitMo” (Zeus in the Mobile). [SEP]
[CLS] The last quarter of 2020 will probably come with some additional changes to the threat landscape, especially since the source code of the <e1>Cerberus</e1> Trojan has been made publicly available. In the coming months we can definitively expect some new malware families, based on Cerberus, to emerge. The most important aspect to take care of is securing the <e2>online banking</e2> channels, making fraud hard to perform, discouraging criminals to attempt the attacks and making it less useful for them to build more malware. [SEP]
[CLS] The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered <e2>Saudi</e2> journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. However, much of the recent reporting about Pegasus centers around a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The list has been attributed to NSO Group, but the list’s origins are unclear. A statement from Amnesty International in Israel stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients, though it’s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. A media consortium, the Pegasus Project, analyzed the phone numbers on the list and identified over 1,000 people in over 50 countries. The findings included people who appear to fall outside of the NSO Group’s restriction to investigations of criminal and terrorist activity. These include politicians, government workers, journalists, human rights activists, business executives and Arab royal family members. Other ways your phone can be tracked Pegasus is breathtaking in its stealth and its seeming ability to take complete control of someone’s phone, but it’s not the only way people can be spied on through their phones. Some of the ways phones can aid surveillance and undermine privacy include location tracking, eavesdropping, malware and collecting data from sensors.

When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices. Hacking Team has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and CVE-2013-6282 in their attacks. The said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor.

[CLS] SMS monitoring or tracking During the research of this trojan, <e1>Kaspersky</e1> found Rotexy trojan (Malware) is the evolution of SMS spyware trojan that was found 4 years back in 2014 and named as Trojan-spy.Androidos.Smsthief. But the modern version of Rotexy Trojan (Malware) combines the functionality of Banking Trojan and Ransomware. It spreads using the name of Avito.pay.apk and downloads from websites with names like youla9d6h.tk, prodam8n9.tk, prodamfkz.ml, avitoe0ys.tk etc. These website names generated on the basis of a clear algorithm: first letter from suggestive ads followed by random characters. In the first version of Rotexy Trojan (Malware), it spreads via a link sent in Phishing SMS that prompt the user to install an application. When installing the application it asked for the device administrator rights and then start communicating to C&C server. In the next version of Rotexy Trojan Malware, it starts using plain text JSON format to communicate C&C server. Then in the next version of Rotexy trojan malware in 2015-2016, it starts using the AES algorithm to encrypt the data between the user’s device and C&C server. In 2017-2018 HTML phishing pages bank.html, update.html ad extortionist.html starts appearing in the assets folder.

[CLS] <e1>FakeSpy</e1> Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps New ‘smishing’ campaigns from the Roaming Mantis threat group infect Android users with the FakeSpy infostealer. Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that’s spreading the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the Android recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing.” One example of a message used in the latest FakeSpy campaign is an alert from the postal service local to the region of the victim, informing them that the service tried to send a package, but the receiver was not at home, for instance. Then, “the link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK),” according to a report on the campaign, by Ofir Almkias, mobile analyst with Cybereason. That APK downloads an app that appears to be from the local region’s legitimate postal service—such as the United States Postal Service (USPS)–but actually executes FakeSpy, an infostealer that requests permissions to take over SMS messages and steal sensitive data on devices. The malware, which has been a threat since 2017, also can access and use a target device’s contact list to infect other devices. Researchers believe that Chinese-speaking group known as “Roaming Mantis” is behind the campaign. Disguising malware as a legitimate mobile app is a hallmark of Roaming Mantis. The last major campaign from the threat group was seen two years ago with a <e2>banking trojan</e2> disguised as Google or Chrome that also targeted Android device users around the globe. [SEP]

[CLS] “Though it’s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps, and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app,” said Pavel Asinovsky, malware researcher with <e2>IBM X-Force</e2>, in a Tuesday analysis. Researchers first discovered the mobile app after a September 2019 tweet by CERT-Bund flagging TrickBot using man-in-the-browser techniques. Man-in-the-browser is a threat related to man-in-the-middle (MiTM), which occurs when an attacker compromises a web browser and then modifies the browser’s web pages. In this case, TrickBot was modifying the pages to ask the victims for their mobile phone numbers and device operating system types (Android or iOS). If victims indicated that they were using Android-based devices, the trojan would then use web injections and social engineering to fool the victim into installing a fake security app — this turned out to be the TrickMo app. Once downloaded, the app steals personal device information, intercepts SMS messages, locks the phone, steals pictures and records the device screen. The malware also has its own kill switch, a feature often used by malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. TrickBot already has various data-stealing capabilities, so why would it deploy an additional piece of malware with these features? Researchers believe that some of TrickMo’s functionalities, specifically the ability to record targeted applications, help the trojan obtain a one-time password (OTP) or transaction authentication number, with the goal of bypassing 2FA protections put in place by banks. “We believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app-recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by <e1>German banks</e1>,” they said.

[CLS] According to X-Force’s analysis, these changes suggest that the downloader app is being maintained on an ongoing basis — another sign that it is a commodity offered to cybercriminals or a specific group that’s focused on defrauding Turkish mobile banking users. <e1>Anubis</e1> Masquerades as Google Protect After a successful installation of the malicious downloader, the app fetches BankBot Anubis from one of its C&C servers. The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called “Google Protect” and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android’s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user’s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user’s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user’s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible. These features are staples of PC banking malware and are evolving in Android malware as well. The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address Turkish users. With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan Luxembourg <e2>Morocco</e2> Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.

[CLS] Ginp Android trojan targets <e2>banking apps</e2> & threatens 2FA/SMS Dubbed Ginp; the trojan keeps coming back with new capabilities. Researchers at ThreatFabric, the cybersecurity firm based in Amsterdam, have been following an “interesting new strain of banking malware” dubbed Ginp distributed as Adobe Flash Player. Identified firstly by Kaspersky’s Android malware analyst Tatyana Shishkova in late October; Ginp is currently targeting users in the UK and Spain. Researchers opine that the Trojan was actually launched in June 2019 and is yet under the active development phase. According to researchers, cybercriminals have released at least five different versions of Ginp in the past five months, which reflects how eagerly cybercriminals are vying to improvise this Trojan. ThreatFabric analysts claim that Ginp is unique because its codebase was developed from scratch and is being expanded continuously through updates. Its target list is also considerably narrow as its main targets are the banks in Spain. The code of Gino has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis. Researchers further claim that there are striking similarities between the codes of both Trojans but it cannot be said that Ginp is the replica of <e1>Anubis</e1> rather it is inspired by Anubis.

More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, <e1>NSO Group</e1> delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. [SEP]
[CLS] The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the <e2>Mexican government</e2> in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. However, much of the recent reporting about Pegasus centers around a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The list has been attributed to NSO Group, but the list’s origins are unclear. A statement from Amnesty International in Israel stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as “of interest” to <e1>NSO</e1>’s various clients, though it’s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. [SEP]
[CLS] After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the <e1>Anubis</e1> malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year. The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after banking app users. Trend Micro mobile threat analyst Tony Bao discovered a variant of Anubis (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_AnubisDropper) of the same type a few months ago. The Anubis variant analyzed in Bao’s research targeted 188 banking- and finance-related apps. In its latest form, Ginp was found with slight modifications, including a new endpoint related to downloading a module and pieces of code borrowed from Anubis. This Ginp iteration targets users of 24 apps from different <e2>Spanish banks</e2>. Security recommendations Ginp’s use of deceptive overlay screens to steal login credentials and credit card details should prompt users to be more vigilant when installing apps on their devices.

In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it’s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target — no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal’s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses – likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal’s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. “While some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,” researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. “An operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,” Citizen Lab noted. “Two other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.” The firm believes with “medium confidence” that <e1>Sneaky Kestrel</e1> acts on behalf of the UAE.

[CLS] 0 also mirrors the way <e2>FakeSpy</e2> hides its real C&C server. When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the Twitter platform, something FakeSpy has done in its past attacks. Analysis of the malicious iOS profile also revealed further connections, as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that FakeSpy deployed early this year. Conclusion and security recommendations The continued monitoring of XLoader showed how its operators continuously changed its features, such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques. This newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won’t be stopping soon. Being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies, as well as prepare for upcoming attacks. In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we’ve also seen in a different malware family like FakeSpy also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple’s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

[CLS] Between <e2>2019</e2> and 2020 these attacks have become increasingly common. Names like Anubis, Hydra, Ginp, or <e1>Gustuff</e1> appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. [SEP]
[CLS] This version appeared as <e2>Wabi Music</e2>, and copied a popular video-sharing social networking service as its backend login page.

[CLS] The spyware is delivered either via the aforementioned app, or via an SMS or email that contain a specially crafted URL that will trigger exploits for several vulnerabilities in the <e2>default browsers</e2> of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean. This will allow the attacker to gain root privilege, and allow the installation of a shell backdoor and RCS Android. The RCS Android has two core modules: the Evidence Collector and the Event Action Trigger. The former is responsible for the spying routines: gathering device information, capturing screenshots and photos, recording speech by using the devices’ microphone, capturing voice calls, recording location, capturing Wi-Fi and online account passwords, collecting contacts and decoding messages from IM accounts, as well as collecting SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages. The latter is in charge of triggering malicious actions based on certain events (e.g. screen turning on, or SMS received with keywords). It can sync configuration data, upgrade modules, and download new payloads; upload the above mentioned collected data to the C&C server, and purge it from the device; execute shell commands; disable the network, root access; reset the device’s locking password; uninstall the bot. “To avoid detection and removal of the agent app in the device memory, the <e1>RCSAndroid</e1> suite also detects emulators or sandboxes, obfuscates code using DexGuard, uses ELF string obfuscator, and adjusts the OOM (out-of-memory) value,” the researchers shared.

[CLS] From mTAN to pushTAN In the past few years, some banks in Europe, especially in <e2>Germany</e2>, stopped using SMS-based authentication and switched to dedicated pushTAN applications for 2FA schemes. Instead of relying on SMS messages, which can be easily intercepted by third-party apps, these applications started using push notifications for users, containing the transaction details and the TAN. The pushTAN method has a clear advantage: It improves security by mitigating the risk of SIM swapping attacks and SMS stealers. TrickMo Calls pushTAN The pushTAN method is a hurdle for malware apps that may reside on the same device, and it’s particularly challenging for mobile malware due to Android’s application sandbox. This feature is designed to block one application from accessing the data of other applications without rooting the device. To get around this challenge, TrickMo’s developers added some new features to steal TANs using screen video recording and screen data scraping. The Root of All (Android) Evil So how does TrickMo get around these security features? It abuses accessibility services. Android’s accessibility services were originally developed by <e1>Google</e1> for the benefit of users with disabilities. [SEP]
[CLS] Once fully installed, Exodus was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from <e2>Facebook Messenger</e2> conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware. The iPhone surveillance malware was distributed on phishing sites that masqueraded as Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Screenshots of the two sites are below: The iOS version was installed using the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute in-house apps to employees or members without using the iOS App Store. The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to “keep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.” The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L. Infected iPhones also connected to domains and IP addresses belonging to Connexxa. <e1>Connexxa</e1> is the same Italian company whose domains and IP addresses were used by Exodus. [SEP]
[CLS] On later versions, specifically <e2>iOS 12.1.1</e2> and iOS 12.2, the process is different. After the profile is downloaded, the iOS system will first ask users to review the profile in their settings if they want to install it. Users can see a “Profile Downloaded” added in their settings (this feature is in iOS 12.2, but not on iOS 12.1.1). This gives users a chance to see details and better understand any changes made. After the review, the process is the same as above. After the profile is installed, the user will then be redirected to another Apple phishing site. The phishing site uses the gathered information as its GET parameter, allowing the attacker to access the stolen information. Ongoing activity While monitoring this particular threat, we found another XLoader variant posing as a pornography app aimed at South Korean users. The "porn kr sex" APK connects to a malicious website that runs XLoader in the background. The website uses a different fixed twitter account (https://twitter.com/fdgoer343). This attack, however, seems exclusive to Android users, as it does not have the code to attack iOS devices. Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms Instagram and Tumblr instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address. We labeled this new variant XLoader version 7.0, because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in Instagram and Tumblr profiles. These more recent developments indicate that XLoader is still evolving. Adding connections to <e1>FakeSpy</e1> We have been seeing activity from XLoader since 2018, and have since followed up our initial findings with a detailed research revealing a wealth of activity dating back to as early as January 2015, which outlined a major discovery—its connection to FakeSpy.

[CLS] Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we’ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, <e2>Turkey</e2>, the UAE, and others. [SEP]
[CLS] 8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, almost six times the size of the user base of <e2>Apple</e2>'s iOS mobile system. Newsweek spoke to Sean Sullivan, security adviser at international online security company F-Secure, about the malware and how Android users can protect themselves. What is DroidJack? In cybersecurity parlance, DroidJack is known as a remote access tool, or RAT. Such tools allow the administrators of large computer networks to obtain access to individual devices from a remote location. However, when they are used maliciously to spy or obtain personal data, they are often referred to as remote access trojans. DroidJack is available to buy on the internet: the software's site, droidjack.net, advertises a lifetime package of the software for $210. Newsweek reached out to the software's founder, who named only as <e1>Sanjeevi</e1> and is based in India, about the purpose of the software. [SEP]
[CLS] XLoader linked to Yanbian hacker group Researchers noted that the two Android malware families XLoader and <e1>FakeSpy</e1> have been found to have links with a Chinese hacker group called Yanbian Gang. Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018. Similarities between XLoader and FakeSpy The malicious domains shared by XLoader and FakeSpy were found to be located in China. The C&C servers were similar for both the malware families. Moreover, XLoader and FakeSpy have collectively infected almost 384,748 victims across the globe, with the majority of victims located in Japan and South Korea. XLoader version 6.0 Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices. This variant is distributed via smishing. XLoader version 6.0 abuses Twitter profiles to hide its C&C server. The malware author has made some changes to this XLoader version in line with its new deployment method. XLoader version 7.0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘XLoader version 7.0’ that poses as a pornography app for Android devices. This variant abuses Instagram and Tumblr profiles to hide its C&C server. XLoader version 7.0 targets <e2>South Korean</e2> Android users. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Gooligan</e1> Android malware grabs a million Google accounts in huge Google Play fraud Dysfunctional Android patching comes back to bite Google via two million fraudulent installs from Google Play in three months. A million Google accounts have been compromised in a massive fraud campaign exploiting Android devices and Google Play. At the heart of the campaign is a new variant of Android malware dubbed Gooligan, concealed in dozens of Android apps that exploit two unpatched flaws in Android to root infected devices. The malware nabs email account information and authentication tokens for accessing Google accounts. The attackers use the tokens to install select apps from Google Play on an infected device to boost in-app advertising revenue. Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Your Android smartphone might still be vulnerable to ancient Ghost Push Trojan Researchers have warned that over half of Android devices are still susceptible to Ghost Push malware. Read More According to Check Point, which reported the issue to Google, these tokens can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, and Google Drive. The security company says one million Google accounts have been compromised this way since August, in what it believes is the largest Google account breach to date. Google users can use Check Point's Gooligan-checker to see if their account has been compromised. Rather than use those tokens to steal information, Gooligan-infected devices are designed to go about fraudulently earning their operators ad revenue. <e2>Check Point</e2> estimates that two million apps have been installed this way over the past three months.

[CLS] ERMAC differs from <e1>Cerberus</e1> in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm. “Despite the usage of different obfuscation techniques and new method of string encryption – using Blowfish encryption algorithm, we can definitely state that ERMAC is another Cerberus-based trojan.” reads the analysis published by Threatfabric. “Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data” The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts. clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device At the time of writing, ThreatFabric researchers with the help of support @malwrhunterteam experts determine that ERMAC is only targeting Poland, where is being distributed under the guise of delivery service and government applications. The new banking trojan can target over three hundred banking and mobile apps. “The story of ERMAC shows one more time how malware source code leaks can lead not only to slow evaporation of the malware family but also bring new threats/actors to the threat landscape. Being built on Cerberus basement, ERMAC introduces couple of new features. Although it lacks some powerful features like RAT, it remains a threat for mobile banking users and <e2>financial institutions</e2> all over the world. [SEP]

Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps. In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as <e2>Chrome</e2>, Google, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.

But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called <e2>Framaroot</e2>, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. Google Play Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the <e2>Google Play</e2> consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year.

Based on the evolution of <e1>Ginp</e1> it is clear that it isn’t based on Anubis, but rather reuses some of its code. Below are some of the elements showing the relation. The names used for <e2>Android</e2> components are similar: Another major change that indicated that the actor copied code from the Anubis Trojan is the way of handling configuration values.
As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. <e1>Evil Eye</e1> leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass <e2>Apple</e2>'s iOS security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia.
” Researchers said they collected samples of <e1>Exodus</e1> from 2016 to early 2019. They found that it has a variety of nefarious capabilities, including scooping up call logs and SMS messages, Facebook, Gmail and WhatsApp data and conversations, audio-recording the victim and extracting GPS coordinates of the phone. It can also retrieve a list of installed apps, retrieve the device’s browsing history, extract events from the Calendar app and access the owner’s address book. “All of the victims are located in <e2>Italy</e2>,” according to Security Without Borders.
<e1>XLoader</e1> Android Spyware and Banking Trojan Distributed via DNS Spoofing We have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early March, which, for now, are targeting Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The attacks use Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing, possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, to distribute and install malicious Android apps. Trend Micro detects these as ANDROIDOS_XLOADER.HRX. These malware pose as legitimate <e2>Facebook</e2> or Chrome applications.
It’s a kind of “digital eye” that reads what’s displayed on the screen, and in the case of <e1>Skygofree</e1>, it collects messages from <e2>WhatsApp</e2>. Using Accessibility Services requires the user’s permission, but the malware hides the request for permission behind some other, seemingly innocent, request.

In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for <e2>Android</e2> devices, dubbed <e1>Black Rose Lucy</e1>, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction.
That includes the expansion of <e1>Pegasus</e1> usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist <e2>Ahmed Mansoor</e2>, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018.

Potent Skygofree Malware Packs ‘Never-Before-Seen’ Features Researchers have identified a powerful new Android malware strain called <e1>Skygofree</e1> capable of eavesdropping on WhatsApp messages, siphoning private data off phones and allowing adversaries to open reverse shell modules on targeted devices, giving attackers ultimate remote control. Researchers said the malware was developed three years ago and has evolved significantly since then to include 48 unique commands in it most recent iteration. Several of those features have never been seen before in <e2>Android</e2> malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the Skygofree strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday.

HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e1>Gooligan</e1>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com. Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.XXXXXXXXX.camera, for example com.bird.sky.whale.camera (app name: <e2>Whale Camera</e2>), com.
As part of the analyzed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> attack, the malware was being distributed attached to spam messages. Although the threat is currently detected by nearly half of the VirusTotal anti-virus companies, the distribution method is still interesting for an <e2>Android</e2> malware family.
SophosLabs has uncovered a mobile malware distribution campaign that uses advertising placement to distribute the <e1>Red Alert</e1> Trojan, linking counterfeit branding of well-known apps to Web pages that deliver an updated, 2.0 version of this bank credential thief. The group distributing this family of malware decorates it in the branding and logos of well-known social media or media player apps, system update patches, or (in its most recent campaign) VPN client apps in an attempt to lure users into downloading, installing, and elevating the privileges of a Trojanized app hosted on a site not affiliated with any reputable app market or store. Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software. The Web page shown here on the left is hosted on a domain that seems apt: free-vpn[.]download. Investigation of this domain led to additional domains that appear to have been registered for use with the campaign, but are not in use yet. (You can find additional IoCs at the end of this article) As you can see, the Web page uses a similar colour scheme as, and the icon design from, a legitimate VPN application (VPN Proxy Master) found on the <e2>Google Play store</e2>. The fake doesn’t quite nail the app name.
FakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and call records stored in the infected device. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> can also serve as a vector for a banking trojan (ANDROIDOS_LOADGFISH.HRX). While the malware is currently limited to infecting <e2>Japanese</e2> and Korean-speaking users, we won't be surprised if it expands its reach given the way FakeSpy’s authors actively fine-tune the malware’s configurations.
And on smartphones made by one of the tech majors, where all apps except for favorites are stopped when the screen is turned off, <e1>Skygofree</e1> adds itself automatically to the favorites list. The malware can also monitor popular apps such as Facebook Messenger, Skype, <e2>Viber</e2>, and WhatsApp.
<e2>Super Mario Run</e2> Malware #2 – <e1>DroidJack</e1> RAT Gamers love Mario and Pokemon, but so do malware authors.
<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, <e2>Airbnb</e2>, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.
In addition to the OTT attack channel, <e1>DroidJack</e1> was also found by researchers with Proofpoint to have been spread last month by a side load attack through a backdoored version of the Android <e2>Pokemon Go</e2> app.
In a 5-month timespan, actor managed to create a Trojan from scratch which will presumably continue evolving offering new features such as keylogging, back-connect proxy or RAT capabilities. <e1>Ginp</e1>’s unusual target selection is not just about its focus on Spanish banks but also the wide selection of targeted apps per bank. The fact that the overlay screens are almost identical to the legitimate banking apps suggests that the actors might be very familiar with the <e2>Spanish</e2> banking applications and might even be accustomed to the language.
This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as <e2>MazarBOT</e2>. Heimdal explains in a blog post that the campaign begins with the following SMS message: In English, the text message reads: “Your package is available for pick up. Follow link to see all the information on your package.” Clicking on the shortened link leads to <e1>www[.]fhsinsaat.com/apk/post.apk,</e1> a URL which downloads the infected Android installation application file for MazarBOT.
<e1>MazarBOT</e1> Android Malware Distributed via SMS Spoofing Campaign In the fall of 2015, Heimdal Security detected a post-office email scam targeting unsuspecting Danish users. The campaign sent out fake emails purporting to originate from PostNord and Post Denmark. When clicked on, the infected emails downloaded Cryptolocker2 ransomware onto users’ machines. Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and <e2>Denmark</e2>, including Post Denmark.

“All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google.” <e1>Exodus</e1> The malware was spread via mobile applications on Google Play purporting to be service apps distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Italy. “Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page,” researchers said. “All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian.” Security Without Borders told Threatpost that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to <e2>Google Play</e2> – and while Google did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand.

The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the <e2>Pegasus</e2> campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as <e1>Chrysaor</e1>, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone.
Another interesting fact about <e1>Pegasus</e1> is that it tries to hide itself really diligently. The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; <e2>NSO</e2>’s clients weren’t going after random victims).
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, <e2>Kyrgyzstan</e2>, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

Something that makes Ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps, first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then stealing the credit card details (to “validate” the user identity), as shown in the screenshots hereafter: Targets The initial version of <e1>Ginp</e1> had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications. Still included in the last versions, this screen is only used to overlay the official Google Play Store app. More apps could be added to the grabber target list in the future, such as the ones that were targeted in older versions: Facebook WhatsApp Skype Twitter Chrome Instagram Snapchat <e2>Viber</e2> The following screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay screen: Based on Anubis Once the Anubis bot code got leaked, it was just a matter of time before new banking Trojans based on Anubis would surface.

Several of those features have never been seen before in Android malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the <e1>Skygofree</e1> strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via <e2>Accessibility Services</e2>; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research.

At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: <e2>Caixa bank</e2>, Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and Santander.

When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, <e2>GetTaxi</e2>, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.

An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and Japan. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include <e2>China</e2>, France, Germany, the UK, and the United States.

At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “<e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2>” apps.
Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. <e2>eSurv</e2>’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down.

A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, <e2>Skype</e2>, Instagram and Twitter.
" The cybersecurity firm says that following the free release of <e1>Cerberus</e1> source code in the underground, there was an "immediate rise" in mobile app infections across Europe and <e2>Russia</e2>. Of particular note, Galov says, is that previous clients were not encouraged to strike Russian mobile device users -- but the moment the code was released, the attack landscape changed.

The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: Caixa bank, Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, EVO Banco, <e2>Kutxabank</e2> and Santander.
"Despite <e1>Cerberus</e1>' <e2>Russian speaking developers</e2> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team," Kaspersky says.

Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. <e2>Google Play</e2> Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the Google Play consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year.

And on smartphones made by one of the tech majors, where all apps except for favorites are stopped when the screen is turned off, <e1>Skygofree</e1> adds itself automatically to the favorites list. The malware can also monitor popular apps such as Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp. In the latter case, the developers again showed savvy — the Trojan reads <e2>WhatsApp</e2> messages through Accessibility Services.
0 includes NatWest, Barclays, Westpac, and Citibank. <e2>Red Alert 2.0</e2> is a banking bot that is currently very active online, and presents a risk to Android devices. We expect to see more diversification in the social engineering lures this threat group employs as time goes on. So far, legitimate app stores appear to be this malware’s Achilles heel; disabling the installation of third-party apps has been an effective prevention measure. Stick to Google Play and use VPN software from reputable vendors. Sophos detects all the samples of this Trojan family as Andr/Banker-GWC and <e1>Andr/Spybot-A</e1>. In the wild, these are only distributed as a direct download from unofficial Web pages (“third-party” app) and not through legitimate app stores.
HummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. <e1>HummingBad</e1> attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of <e2>Android</e2>. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous <e2>Anubis</e2> Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019).
<e1>XLoader</e1> Android Spyware and Banking Trojan Distributed via DNS Spoofing We have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early March, which, for now, are targeting Japan, <e2>Korea</e2>, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
Flossman believes that <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>Android</e2> was delivered in a similar fashion to its iPhone equivalent, via an SMS message.
In early July, Avast researchers discovered <e1>Cerberus</e1> in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate <e2>currency converter</e2>. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices.
HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e2>Gooligan</e2>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com. Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.XXXXXXXXX.camera, for example <e1>com.bird.sky.whale.camera</e1> (app name: Whale Camera), com.
In a 5-month timespan, actor managed to create a Trojan from scratch which will presumably continue evolving offering new features such as keylogging, back-connect proxy or RAT capabilities. <e1>Ginp</e1>’s unusual target selection is not just about its focus on Spanish banks but also the wide selection of targeted apps per bank. The fact that the overlay screens are almost identical to the legitimate banking apps suggests that the actors might be very familiar with the Spanish <e2>banking applications</e2> and might even be accustomed to the language.

An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in <e2>South Korea</e2> and Japan.
Facebook disrupts hackers who used iOS exploits, malware to spy on Uyghurs Facebook on Wednesday said it successfully cut off a hacking operation that used the social media platform to spread the so-called <e1>Insomnia</e1> malware, a malicious program leveraged in an effort to spy on <e2>Uyghur Muslims</e2> from Xinjiang, China.
<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and <e2>Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India</e2>) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.

The malware (<e1>Dvmap</e1>) was uploaded to Google Play Store masked as several simple apps such as <e2>Puzzle Games</e2>. Kaspersky lab claimed that the malicious apps have been downloaded around 50,000 times before being removed by Google.
Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an <e2>Italian company</e2> called eSurv.

Google Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. <e1>Pegasus for iPhone</e1> was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist <e2>Ahmed Mansoor</e2>, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, <e2>Jordan</e2>, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. Google Play Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the Google Play consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year. Just in this past January, Google Play removed two malicious apps that were infecting devices with a notorious banking malware bent on harvesting victims’ credentials. Also, last month an Android spyware dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims’ phones, mainly via Google Play. Also, early last year, Google removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights and call recorders to WiFi signal boosters, which together were downloaded at least 7.5 million times from the Google Play marketplace. Researchers said that <e2>Google Play</e2> told them that: “thanks to enhanced detection models, Google Play Protect will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications.

Something that makes Ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps, first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then stealing the credit card details (to “validate” the user identity), as shown in the screenshots hereafter: Targets The initial version of <e1>Ginp</e1> had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications. Still included in the last versions, this screen is only used to overlay the official Google Play Store app. More apps could be added to the grabber target list in the future, such as the ones that were targeted in older versions: Facebook WhatsApp Skype Twitter Chrome Instagram <e2>Snapchat</e2> Viber The following screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay screen: Based on Anubis Once the Anubis bot code got leaked, it was just a matter of time before new banking Trojans based on Anubis would surface.
The greatest number of <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android installations was observed in <e2>Israel</e2>, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third.
What makes <e1>Ginp</e1> stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware. In addition, its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on Spanish banks. Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then their credit card details. Although multi-step overlays are not something new, their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion. Evolution The initial version of the malware dates back to early June 2019, masquerading as a “<e2>Google Play Verificator</e2>” app.
Backdoor Commands The <e2>Red Alert</e2> code also contains an embedded list of commands the botmaster can send to the bot. The malware can execute a variety of arbitrary commands, including (for example) intercepting or sending text messages without the user’s knowledge, obtaining a copy of the victim’s Address Book, or call or text message logs, or sending phone network feature codes (also known as USSD codes). C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app’s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we’ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we’ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we’ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on <e1>port 7878/tcp</e1>. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a Twitter account.

<e1>MazarBOT</e1> Android Malware Distributed via SMS Spoofing Campaign In the fall of 2015, Heimdal Security detected a post-office email scam targeting unsuspecting Danish users. The campaign sent out fake emails purporting to originate from PostNord and Post Denmark. When clicked on, the infected emails downloaded Cryptolocker2 ransomware onto users’ machines. Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in <e2>Italy</e2> and Denmark, including Post Denmark.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. <e2>google play</e2> malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv.

Google Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. <e1>Pegasus for iPhone</e1> was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a <e2>Mexican</e2> journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi.
<e2>Dvmap</e2> – The First Android-Rooting Malware With Code Injection Ability Found In Google Play Store Security Researchers at Kaspersky Lab observed a new rooting malware being distributed through the Google Play Store. Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries. Kaspersky Lab products detect it as <e1>Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a.</e1> The distribution of rooting malware through Google Play is not a new thing.

An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and <e2>Japan</e2>. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe.

Backdoor Commands The <e1>Red Alert</e1> code also contains an embedded list of commands the botmaster can send to the bot. The malware can execute a variety of arbitrary commands, including (for example) intercepting or sending text messages without the user’s knowledge, obtaining a copy of the victim’s Address Book, or call or text message logs, or sending phone network feature codes (also known as USSD codes). C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app’s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we’ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we’ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we’ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on port 7878/tcp. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a <e2>Twitter</e2> account.
In addition to “Free VPN Master Android,” we’ve observed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> Trojans in the wild disguising themselves using names like: <e2>Flash Player</e2> or Update Flash Player Android Update or Android Antivirus Chrome Update or Google Update Update Google Market WhatsApp Viber OneCoin Wallet Pornhub Tactic FlashLight or PROFlashLight Finanzonline The vast majority of in-the-wild Red Alert 2.
Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps. In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, Google, <e2>Google Play</e2>, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.

Summary PHA authors go to great lengths to come up with increasingly clever ways to monetize their apps. <e1>Zen</e1> family PHA authors exhibit a wide range of techniques, from simply inserting an advertising SDK to a sophisticated trojan. The app that resulted in the largest number of affected users was the click fraud version, which was installed over 170,000 times at its peak in February 2018. The most affected countries were India, <e2>Brazil</e2>, and Indonesia.
With this blog series we will be sharing our research analysis with the research and broader security community, starting with the PHA family, Zen. <e1>Zen</e1> uses root permissions on a device to automatically enable a service that creates <e2>fake Google accounts</e2>. These accounts are created by abusing accessibility services.
In a 5-month timespan, actor managed to create a Trojan from scratch which will presumably continue evolving offering new features such as keylogging, back-connect proxy or RAT capabilities. <e1>Ginp</e1>’s unusual target selection is not just about its focus on Spanish banks but also the wide selection of targeted apps per bank. The fact that the overlay screens are almost identical to the legitimate banking apps suggests that the actors might be very familiar with the Spanish banking applications and might even be accustomed to the language. Although the current target list is limited to <e2>Spanish apps,</e2> it seems that the actor is taking into account that the bot should also be able to target other countries, seeing that the path used in the inject requests contains the country code of the targeted institution.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, <e2>India</e2>, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: Caixa bank, Bankinter, Bankia, <e2>BBVA</e2>, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and Santander.

" Google said <e1>Pegasus</e1> never found its way onto the official Play store. But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called Framaroot, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system. Other Android samples may use zero-days, Lookout warned. Google found most targets were located in Israel, though individuals in numerous countries were targeted, including Georgia, Mexico, Turkey and the <e2>UAE</e2>. NSO Group hadn't responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, <e2>Snapchat</e2>, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.
Kaspersky Lab researchers said <e1>Skygofree</e1>’s advanced spy features also included recording Skype conversations and the unique ability to capture WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted conversations via exploiting Android Accessibility Services designed to assist users with disabilities. “The payload uses the Android Accessibility Service to get information directly from the displayed elements on the screen, so it waits for the targeted application to be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages,” researchers wrote regarding capturing WhatsApp conversations. “Note that the implant needs special permission to use the <e2>Accessibility Service</e2> API, but there is a command that performs a request with a phishing text displayed to the user to obtain such permission.
Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on June 2015; the latest variant was signed on May 2017. <e1>AnubisSpy</e1> wasn’t only published on Google Play. We also found versions of it in <e2>third-party app marketplaces</e2>, most likely as a way to expand the malware’s reach.
In May 2020, <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted <e2>Brazilian</e2> users.
“All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google.” <e1>Exodus</e1> The malware was spread via mobile applications on Google Play purporting to be service apps distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Italy. “Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page,” researchers said. “All of the <e2>Play Store</e2> pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. <e2>eSurv</e2>, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems.

It is interesting to observe that the actual target list contains: 7 French banking apps 7 U.S. banking apps 1 <e2>Japanese banking app</e2> 15 non-banking apps This uncommon target list might either be the result of specific customer demand, or due to some actors having partially reused an existing target list.

" As detailed in a report from security firm Volexity last year, <e1>Insomnia</e1> worked on any web browser running in all versions of iOS 10 and 11, as well as iOS 12.0, 12.1, 12.3, 12.3.1 and iOS 12.3.2. Once installed, the malware granted access to a user's Contacts, location, Messages data, and information from third-party apps. Apple patched the offending <e2>WebKit flaw</e2> in iOS 12.
Based on the titles and the icons of the malicious apps, the experts concluded that <e1>Monokle</e1> is used in highly targeted attacks against specific sets of users. Some of the applications were clearly designed to catch the attention of people associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria. Others were aimed at users situated in the former Soviet republic of <e2>Uzbekistan</e2>, and a third group targeted people situated in the Caucasus region of Eastern Europe.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to <e2>Spanish banks</e2>, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan.

Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including <e2>WhatsApp</e2>), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

Researchers at Check Point said they found the malware, dubbed <e1>Judy</e1>, on about 50 apps in Google's <e2>Play Store</e2>. The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators.
The manner by which <e1>FakeSpy</e1> spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn’t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user’s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user’s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information. As to where the malware originated from, researchers claim that all signs point to a Chinese group known as “<e2>Roaming Mantis</e2>.” Cybereason concludes: The malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped.

Something that makes Ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps, first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then stealing the credit card details (to “validate” the user identity), as shown in the screenshots hereafter: Targets The initial version of <e1>Ginp</e1> had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications.

Android Accessibility Services Vulnerable to <e2>Android</e2> Malware <e1>Defensor ID</e1> Android Accessibility Services has been caught with unexpected consequences as hackers are creating sneaky malware to use this service for malicious intents and to interact with the system’s interface and applications.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, <e2>Singapore</e2>, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.
Several of those features have never been seen before in Android malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the <e1>Skygofree</e1> strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research. Clues as to who is behind the malware trace back to the Italian firm <e2>Negg International</e2>. Researchers said domains used for landing pages to spread the malware were registered to the company.

An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of <e2>Android</e2> malware called <e1>FakeSpy</e1> has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason.
In addition to “Free VPN Master Android,” we’ve observed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> Trojans in the wild disguising themselves using names like: Flash Player or Update Flash Player Android Update or Android Antivirus Chrome Update or <e2>Google</e2> Update Update Google Market WhatsApp Viber OneCoin Wallet Pornhub Tactic FlashLight or PROFlashLight Finanzonline The vast majority of in-the-wild Red Alert 2.
<e2>XLoader</e2> Android Spyware and Banking Trojan Distributed via DNS Spoofing We have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early March, which, for now, are targeting Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The attacks use Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing, possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, to distribute and install malicious Android apps. Trend Micro detects these as <e1>ANDROIDOS_XLOADER.HRX.</e1> These malware pose as legitimate Facebook or Chrome applications.
" Google said <e1>Pegasus</e1> never found its way onto the official Play store. But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called Framaroot, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system. Other Android samples may use zero-days, Lookout warned. Google found most targets were located in Israel, though individuals in numerous countries were targeted, including <e2>Georgia</e2>, Mexico, Turkey and the UAE.
We reverse engineered <e1>XLoader</e1> and found that it appears to target South Korea-based banks and <e2>game development companies</e2>. XLoader also prevents victims from accessing the device’s settings or using a known antivirus (AV) app in the country.
Once it has been fully downloaded onto a computer, <e1>MazarBOT</e1> has the ability to open, monitor and control backdoors on the victim’s Android device; send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, which will increase the victim’s mobile phone bill; read SMS messages, including two-step verification codes; use the “<e2>Polipo proxy</e2>” to launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks; and inject itself in the mobile Google Chrome browser.

<e1>Pegasus</e1>: The ultimate spyware for iOS and <e2>Android</e2> Apple iPhone and iPad users usually believe they are safe.
As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. <e1>Evil Eye</e1> leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass Apple's iOS security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia. In addition to watering hole attacks, the group used fake <e2>Facebook</e2> accounts to build trust with targets before prompting them to click on malicious links, Facebook said.
The researchers at Kaspersky explained: <e1>Dvmap</e1> Trojan works on both <e2>32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android</e2>, which once installed, attempts to gain root access on the device and tries to install several modules on the system including a few written in Chinese, along with a malicious app called “com.

<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, <e2>LINE</e2>, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.

HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e1>Gooligan</e1>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com. Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.XXXXXXXXX.camera, for example com.bird.sky.whale.camera (app name: Whale Camera), com.color.rainbow.camera (Rainbow Camera), and com.fishing.when.orangecamera (<e2>Orange Camera</e2>).

Rooting trojans The <e1>Zen</e1> authors have also created a rooting trojan. Using a publicly available rooting framework, the PHA attempts to root devices and gain persistence on them by reinstalling itself on the system partition of rooted device. Installing apps on the system partition makes it harder for the user to remove the app. This technique only works for unpatched devices running <e2>Android 4.3 or lower</e2>. Devices running Android 4.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting <e2>social apps</e2>, but focusing on banking instead.

It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for <e2>STC</e2>, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called <e1>Monokle</e1>. Monokle and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible.

SophosLabs has uncovered a mobile malware distribution campaign that uses advertising placement to distribute the <e2>Red Alert</e2> Trojan, linking counterfeit branding of well-known apps to Web pages that deliver an updated, 2.0 version of this bank credential thief. The group distributing this family of malware decorates it in the branding and logos of well-known social media or media player apps, system update patches, or (in its most recent campaign) VPN client apps in an attempt to lure users into downloading, installing, and elevating the privileges of a Trojanized app hosted on a site not affiliated with any reputable app market or store. Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software. The Web page shown here on the left is hosted on a domain that seems apt: free-vpn[.]download. Investigation of this domain led to additional domains that appear to have been registered for use with the campaign, but are not in use yet. (You can find additional IoCs at the end of this article) As you can see, the Web page uses a similar colour scheme as, and the icon design from, a legitimate VPN application (VPN Proxy Master) found on the Google Play store. The fake doesn’t quite nail the app name. In addition to “Free VPN Master Android,” we’ve observed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> Trojans in the wild disguising themselves using names like: Flash Player or Update Flash Player Android Update or Android Antivirus Chrome Update or Google Update Update Google Market WhatsApp Viber OneCoin Wallet Pornhub Tactic FlashLight or PROFlashLight Finanzonline The vast majority of in-the-wild Red Alert 2.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. <e2>eSurv</e2> Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv.
Also known by the monikers <e1>VAMP</e1>, <e2>FrozenCell</e2>, GnatSpy, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, <e2>Spain</e2>, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.
That means the malware is commercial — it’s sold to whoever is willing to pay for it. <e1>Pegasus</e1> relied on a whopping three zero-day (previously unknown) vulnerabilities in <e2>iOS</e2> that allowed it to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software.
An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and Japan. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, Germany, the UK, and the <e2>United States</e2>. The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, <e2>Brazil</e2>, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: Caixa bank, Bankinter, <e2>Bankia</e2>, BBVA, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and Santander.

The <e1>Red Alert</e1> Payload Once installed, the malware requests Device Administrator privileges. If the malware obtains device administrator rights, it will be able to lock the screen by itself, expire the password, and resist being uninstalled through normal methods. The app then stays in the background listening to commands from the cybercrooks. Within some of the first of those commands, the bot typically receives a list of banks it will target. The Trojan works by creating an overlay whenever the user launches the banking application. Currently Running Applications Banking Trojans that rely on the overlay mechanism to steal information need to know what application is in the foreground. They do this not only to identify whether the use of a particular app may permit them to harvest another credential, but also because each targeted app needs to have an overlay mapped to its design, so the Trojan can intercept and steal user data. This quest to determine the currently running application is a hallmark of overlay malware, so we thought we’d take a closer look at how it’s done. To prevent this, Android’s engineers regularly release updates that contain bug fixes designed to prevent apps from getting the list of currently running apps without explicit permission. With every <e2>Android</e2> update, the malware authors are forced to come up with new tricks.

If what Lookout's experts say is true, <e2>Monokle</e2> is most likely used by <e1>Russian government agencies</e1> which are trying to spy on particular individuals.
Based on the titles and the icons of the malicious apps, the experts concluded that <e1>Monokle</e1> is used in highly targeted attacks against specific sets of users. Some of the applications were clearly designed to catch the attention of people associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in <e2>Syria</e2>. Others were aimed at users situated in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, and a third group targeted people situated in the Caucasus region of Eastern Europe.

An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and Japan. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, <e2>France</e2>, Germany, the UK, and the United States.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. Google Play Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the Google Play consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year.

<e1>XLoader</e1> <e2>Android</e2> Spyware and Banking Trojan Distributed via DNS Spoofing We have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early March, which, for now, are targeting Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
The most widespread campaign last seen using <e1>Anubis</e1> was in February, a new phishing campaign targeting more than 250 <e2>Android</e2> apps was aimed at using the trojan to steal user credentials, install a keylogger, and even hold a device’s data for ransom.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as <e2>Google Play,</e2> Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter.

After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android, also known as <e2>Chrysaor</e2> — that’s what Google calls it.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, <e2>Thailand</e2>, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.
The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android was also spotted in Turkey, <e2>Kenya</e2>, Nigeria, UAE, and other countries.

Previous to that, IBM’s X-Force team spotted <e1>Anubis</e1> in a campaign that used 10 malicious downloaders disguised as various Google Play applications to fetch the mobile banking trojan and run it on <e2>Android</e2> devices.
HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e2>Gooligan</e2>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com. Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.XXXXXXXXX.camera, for example com.bird.sky.whale.camera (app name: Whale Camera), <e1>com.color.rainbow.camera</e1> (Rainbow Camera), and com.
<e1>FakeSpy</e1> Targets <e2>Japanese</e2> and Korean-Speaking Users Spoofing legitimate mobile applications is a common cybercriminal modus that banks on their popularity and relies on their users’ trust to steal information or deliver payloads.
Researchers at Check Point said they found the malware, dubbed <e1>Judy</e1>, on about 50 apps in Google's Play Store. The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators. The infected apps have been removed from the Play Store. More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, <e2>Kiniwini</e2>, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name Enistudio.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: Caixa bank, Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and <e2>Santander</e2>. The specific apps can be found in the target list in the appendix.
0 includes NatWest, Barclays, Westpac, and Citibank. <e2>Red Alert 2.0</e2> is a banking bot that is currently very active online, and presents a risk to Android devices. We expect to see more diversification in the social engineering lures this threat group employs as time goes on. So far, legitimate app stores appear to be this malware’s Achilles heel; disabling the installation of third-party apps has been an effective prevention measure. Stick to Google Play and use VPN software from reputable vendors. Sophos detects all the samples of this Trojan family as <e1>Andr/Banker-GWC</e1> and Andr/Spybot-A.
<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, <e2>Instagram</e2>, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.
Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps <e2>eSurv</e2> Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv.
That includes the expansion of <e1>Pegasus</e1> usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the <e2>Middle East</e2> – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018.
For example, the <e1>Ztorg Trojan</e1> has been uploaded to <e2>Google Play Store</e2> almost 100 times since September 2016.

For example, the Ztorg Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play Store almost 100 times since September 2016. But <e2>Dvmap</e2> is a unique rooting malware because it uses a variety of new techniques. The most interesting thing, as stated above, is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries, such as <e1>libdmv.so</e1> or libandroid_runtime.

Researchers with nonprofit security firm Security Without Borders said that they uncovered the spyware, dubbed <e1>Exodus</e1>, being passed through at least 25 malicious apps on Google Play. The apps have since been removed. “Instances of this spyware were found on the <e2>Google Play Store</e2>, disguised as service applications from mobile operators,” said researchers in a Friday analysis.
“All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google.” <e1>Exodus</e1> The malware was spread via mobile applications on Google Play purporting to be service apps distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Italy. “Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the <e2>Play Store</e2> page,” researchers said.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, <e2>Kenya</e2>, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

FakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and call records stored in the infected device. <e1>FakeSpy</e1> can also serve as a vector for a banking trojan (ANDROIDOS_LOADGFISH.HRX). While the malware is currently limited to infecting Japanese and Korean-speaking users, we won't be surprised if it expands its reach given the way FakeSpy’s authors actively fine-tune the malware’s configurations. Attack Chain Would-be victims will first receive a mobile text message masquerading as a legitimate message from a Japanese logistics and transportation company urging recipients to click the link in the SMS, as shown in Figure 1. The link will redirect them to the malicious webpage, and clicking any button will prompt users to download an Android application package (APK). The webpage also has a guide, written in Japanese, on how to download and install the app. Further analysis indicates that this campaign also targets South Korean users, and has been active since October 2017. To <e2>Korean</e2> users, the information-stealing malware appears as an app for several local consumer financial services companies.
Kaspersky Lab researchers said <e1>Skygofree</e1>’s advanced spy features also included recording Skype conversations and the unique ability to capture WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted conversations via exploiting Android Accessibility Services designed to assist users with disabilities. “The payload uses the <e2>Android Accessibility Service</e2> to get information directly from the displayed elements on the screen, so it waits for the targeted application to be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages,” researchers wrote regarding capturing WhatsApp conversations.
In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named <e1>Eventbot</e1>, that abused Android’s <e2>Accessibility</e2> features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.
Also known by the monikers <e1>VAMP</e1>, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the <e2>APT-C-23</e2> threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.
Announced in a blog post, Facebook's action targeted a group of hackers known in the security community as <e1>Earth Empusa</e1> or Evil Eye. The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the Chinese government, deployed iOS and Android malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents. Uyghurs from <e2>Xinjiang</e2> who moved abroad were the main target of the group's activities.
Dangerous malware, old infection tricks <e1>Skygofree</e1> is definitely a complicated piece of malware, but it’s getting installed on <e2>Android</e2> devices using the same old tricks: It’s hosted on malicious websites designed to mimic legitimate ones.
Based on the titles and the icons of the malicious apps, the experts concluded that <e1>Monokle</e1> is used in highly targeted attacks against specific sets of users. Some of the applications were clearly designed to catch the attention of people associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria. Others were aimed at users situated in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, and a third group targeted people situated in the Caucasus region of <e2>Eastern Europe</e2>. If what Lookout's experts say is true, Monokle is most likely used by Russian government agencies which are trying to spy on particular individuals.

0 includes NatWest, Barclays, Westpac, and Citibank. <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> is a banking bot that is currently very active online, and presents a risk to Android devices. We expect to see more diversification in the social engineering lures this threat group employs as time goes on. So far, legitimate app stores appear to be this malware’s Achilles heel; disabling the installation of third-party apps has been an effective prevention measure. Stick to <e2>Google Play</e2> and use VPN software from reputable vendors.

In early July, Avast researchers discovered <e1>Cerberus</e1> in <e2>Google Play</e2>, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with <e2>Snapchat</e2> and Viber.

<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, <e2>UBER</e2>, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.

A few days back, we wrote about an Android <e1>Marcher</e1> trojan variant posing as the <e2>Super Mario Run</e2> game for Android.
Researchers with nonprofit security firm Security Without Borders said that they uncovered the spyware, dubbed <e1>Exodus</e1>, being passed through at least 25 malicious apps on <e2>Google Play</e2>. The apps have since been removed.
An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and Japan. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, Germany, the <e2>UK</e2>, and the United States.
SophosLabs has uncovered a mobile malware distribution campaign that uses advertising placement to distribute the <e1>Red Alert</e1> Trojan, linking counterfeit branding of well-known apps to Web pages that deliver an updated, 2.0 version of this bank credential thief. The group distributing this family of malware decorates it in the branding and logos of well-known social media or media player apps, system update patches, or (in its most recent campaign) VPN client apps in an attempt to lure users into downloading, installing, and elevating the privileges of a Trojanized app hosted on a site not affiliated with any reputable app market or store. Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or <e2>social media app</e2>. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software.
And on smartphones made by one of the tech majors, where all apps except for favorites are stopped when the screen is turned off, <e1>Skygofree</e1> adds itself automatically to the favorites list. The malware can also monitor popular apps such as <e2>Facebook Messenger</e2>, Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp.

HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e1>Gooligan</e1>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with <e2>Google Play</e2> ratings.
Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. Google Play Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the Google Play consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year. Just in this past January, Google Play removed two malicious apps that were infecting devices with a notorious banking malware bent on harvesting victims’ credentials. Also, last month an Android spyware dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims’ phones, mainly via Google Play. Also, early last year, Google removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights and call recorders to WiFi signal boosters, which together were downloaded at least 7.5 million times from the <e2>Google Play</e2> marketplace.

" As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of <e1>HummingWhale</e1> is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps. When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine. That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues. Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate <e2>Google Play</e2>. It has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device.

In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software. The Web page shown here on the left is hosted on a domain that seems apt: free-vpn[.]download. Investigation of this domain led to additional domains that appear to have been registered for use with the campaign, but are not in use yet. (You can find additional IoCs at the end of this article) As you can see, the Web page uses a similar colour scheme as, and the icon design from, a legitimate VPN application (<e2>VPN Proxy Master</e2>) found on the Google Play store.

Several of those features have never been seen before in Android malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the <e1>Skygofree</e1> strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research. Clues as to who is behind the malware trace back to the Italian firm Negg International. Researchers said domains used for landing pages to spread the malware were registered to the company. <e2>Negg International</e2> did not return requests for comment.
The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. <e1>Pegasus</e1> for Android was also spotted in Turkey, Kenya, Nigeria, <e2>UAE</e2>, and other countries.
<e2>Red Alert 2.0</e2>: Android Trojan targets security-seekers A malicious, counterfeit version of a VPN client for mobile devices targets security-minded victims with a RAT.

DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new <e2>Android</e2> malware strain called “<e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1>” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts.

It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for STC, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called Monokle. <e1>Monokle</e1> and the <e2>STC</e2> connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible.

<e1>MazarBOT</e1> Android Malware Distributed via SMS Spoofing Campaign In the fall of 2015, Heimdal Security detected a post-office email scam targeting unsuspecting Danish users. The campaign sent out fake emails purporting to originate from PostNord and Post Denmark. When clicked on, the infected emails downloaded Cryptolocker2 ransomware onto users’ machines. Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and Denmark, including <e2>Post Denmark</e2>. This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as MazarBOT.
Announced in a blog post, Facebook's action targeted a group of hackers known in the security community as <e1>Earth Empusa</e1> or Evil Eye. The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the Chinese government, deployed <e2>iOS</e2> and Android malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, <e2>Instagram</e2> and Twitter.
<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, <e2>eBay</e2>, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.
What makes <e1>Ginp</e1> stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware. In addition, its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on <e2>Spanish banks</e2>. Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then their credit card details.

HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e2>Gooligan</e2>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com. Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.XXXXXXXXX.camera, for example com.bird.sky.whale.camera (app name: Whale Camera), com.color.rainbow.camera (Rainbow Camera), and <e1>com.fishing.when.orangecamera</e1> (Orange Camera).
More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, <e2>Kiniwini</e2>, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name <e1>Enistudio</e1>. The games, all of which feature a character called Judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times.

The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different <e2>Spanish banks</e2>: Caixa bank, Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and Santander.
Users need to be aware of the existence of malware like <e1>Skygofree</e1>, and what to watch out for, namely that a legitimate website won’t offer a download that speeds up your device, especially not one that you have to manually navigate to and install yourself. Configuration updates for <e2>Android</e2> and carrier settings will come over the air, not as a manual download.
Announced in a blog post, Facebook's action targeted a group of hackers known in the security community as <e1>Earth Empusa</e1> or Evil Eye. The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the Chinese government, deployed iOS and <e2>Android</e2> malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents.
The researchers at Kaspersky explained: <e1>Dvmap</e1> Trojan works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android, which once installed, attempts to gain root access on the device and tries to install several modules on the system including a few written in Chinese, along with a malicious app called “com.qualcmm.timeservices. To make sure the malicious module gets executed with system rights, the malware overwrites system’s runtime libraries depending on which <e2>Android</e2> version the device is running.

so. The <e1>Dvmap</e1> malware is designed to specifically target Android Smart Phone users. The technique used to distribute the malware via <e2>Google Play Store</e2> were quite unique.
The malware is distributed through fake mobile operator websites, where <e1>Skygofree</e1> is disguised as an update to improve mobile Internet speed. If a user swallows the bait and downloads the Trojan, it displays a notification that setup is supposedly in progress, conceals itself from the user, and requests further instructions from the command server. Depending on the response, it can download a variety of payloads — the attackers have solutions for almost every occasion. Forewarned is forearmed To date, our cloud protection service has logged only a few infections, all in <e2>Italy</e2>. But that doesn’t mean that users in other countries can let their guard down; malware distributors can change their target audience at any moment.
Currently, this particular <e1>MazarBOT</e1> campaign is believed to have affected 400 <e2>Android</e2> devices in Denmark and 1,500 in Italy.
Something that makes Ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps, first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then stealing the credit card details (to “validate” the user identity), as shown in the screenshots hereafter: Targets The initial version of <e1>Ginp</e1> had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications. Still included in the last versions, this screen is only used to overlay the official Google Play Store app. More apps could be added to the grabber target list in the future, such as the ones that were targeted in older versions: Facebook WhatsApp Skype Twitter Chrome <e2>Instagram</e2> Snapchat Viber The following screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay screen: Based on Anubis Once the Anubis bot code got leaked, it was just a matter of time before new banking Trojans based on Anubis would surface.
Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps. In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, Google, Google Play, and <e2>YouTube</e2>, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.
Since <e1>Ginp</e1> is already using some code from the <e2>Anubis</e2> Trojan, it is quite likely that other, more advanced features from Anubis or other malware, such as a back-connect proxy, screen-streaming and RAT will also be added in the future.
Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. <e1>HummingWhale</e1>, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official <e2>app stores</e2> as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars.
Researchers at Check Point said they found the malware, dubbed <e1>Judy</e1>, on about 50 apps in Google's Play Store. The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators. The infected apps have been removed from the <e2>Play Store</e2>. More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, Kiniwini, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name Enistudio.

And on smartphones made by one of the tech majors, where all apps except for favorites are stopped when the screen is turned off, <e1>Skygofree</e1> adds itself automatically to the favorites list. The malware can also monitor popular apps such as Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, and <e2>WhatsApp</e2>. In the latter case, the developers again showed savvy — the Trojan reads WhatsApp messages through Accessibility Services.

Kaspersky Lab researchers said <e1>Skygofree</e1>’s advanced spy features also included recording Skype conversations and the unique ability to capture <e2>WhatsApp</e2> end-to-end encrypted conversations via exploiting Android Accessibility Services designed to assist users with disabilities.
Researchers allege that the apps have infected several hundred – up to even as many as a thousand – <e2>Italian</e2> victims with the malware, dubbed <e1>Exodus</e1>. Researchers with nonprofit security firm Security Without Borders said that they uncovered the spyware, dubbed Exodus, being passed through at least 25 malicious apps on Google Play.
<e1>Ginp</e1> - A malware patchwork borrowing from <e2>Anubis</e2> Intro ThreatFabric analysts have recently investigated an interesting new strain of banking malware.
If they match <e1>FakeSpy</e1>’s apps of interest, they are replaced with counterfeit/repackaged versions that imitate the user interfaces (UI) of their legitimate counterparts. It phishes for the users’ accounts by ironically notifying users that they need to key in their credentials due to upgrades made on the app to address information leaks. It also warns users that their account will be locked. The stolen information is sent to the C&C server once the users click on the login button. Besides online banking apps, it also checks for apps used for digital currencies trading and <e2>e-commerce</e2>. Evading Detection FakeSpy’s author uses different approaches to hide and update the C&C servers.
The researchers at Kaspersky explained: <e2>Dvmap</e2> Trojan works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android, which once installed, attempts to gain root access on the device and tries to install several modules on the system including a few written in Chinese, along with a malicious app called <e1>“com.qualcmm.timeservices.</e1> To make sure the malicious module gets executed with system rights, the malware overwrites system’s runtime libraries depending on which Android version the device is running.
All this is pretty standard for this type of malware. <e1>Monokle</e1> does have a few other tricks up its sleeve that make it stand out from the crowd, though. It uses Android's accessibility services to capture and exfiltrate information from <e2>Microsoft Office</e2> and Google Docs files as well as instant messaging applications like Whatsapp, Viber, Snapchat, etc.
There actually is malware in the wild that targets <e2>iOS</e2> users — it’s been proved a number of times, and in August 2016 researchers proved it again by revealing the existence of <e1>Pegasus</e1>, spyware capable of hacking any iPad or iPhone, harvesting data about the victim, and establishing surveillance on them.

“At least six countries with significant <e1>Pegasus</e1> operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, <e2>Mexico</e2>, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Appendix Samples Some of the latest <e1>Ginp</e1> samples found in the wild: App name Package name SHA-256 hash <e2>Google Play Verificator</e2> sing.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, <e2>Canada</e2>, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: Caixa bank, <e2>Bankinter</e2>, Bankia, BBVA, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and Santander.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. Google Play Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the Google Play consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year. Just in this past January, Google Play removed two malicious apps that were infecting devices with a notorious banking malware bent on harvesting victims’ credentials. Also, last month an Android spyware dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims’ phones, mainly via Google Play. Also, early last year, Google removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights and call recorders to WiFi signal boosters, which together were downloaded at least 7.5 million times from the Google Play marketplace. Researchers said that Google Play told them that: “thanks to enhanced detection models, <e2>Google Play Protect</e2> will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications.

“The number of <e1>Pegasus</e1> servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the <e2>NSO Group</e2> was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims.
Researchers describe Skygofree as a complex system capable of a wide range of spying, similar to Pegasus discovered in August 2016. <e1>Pegasus</e1> was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the <e2>NSO Group</e2>. Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident.

<e1>Virulent</e1> Android malware returns, gets >2 million downloads on <e2>Google Play</e2> A virulent family of malware that infected more than 10 million Android devices last year has made a comeback, this time hiding inside Google Play apps that have been downloaded by as many as 12 million unsuspecting users.

SophosLabs has uncovered a mobile malware distribution campaign that uses advertising placement to distribute the <e1>Red Alert</e1> Trojan, linking counterfeit branding of well-known apps to Web pages that deliver an updated, 2.0 version of this bank credential thief. The group distributing this family of malware decorates it in the branding and logos of well-known social media or media player apps, system update patches, or (in its most recent campaign) VPN client apps in an attempt to lure users into downloading, installing, and elevating the privileges of a Trojanized app hosted on a site not affiliated with any reputable app market or store. Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a <e2>media player</e2> or social media app.

Several of those features have never been seen before in Android malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the <e1>Skygofree</e1> strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of <e2>WhatsApp</e2> messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research.
Speaking at Kaspersky NEXT 2020 on Wednesday, Kaspersky cybersecurity researcher Dmitry Galov said that the leaked code, distributed under the name Cerberus v2, presents an increased threat for smartphone users and the banking sector at large. <e1>Cerberus</e1> is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing <e2>banking, retail, and social networking apps</e2>. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections.

All this is pretty standard for this type of malware. <e1>Monokle</e1> does have a few other tricks up its sleeve that make it stand out from the crowd, though. It uses Android's accessibility services to capture and exfiltrate information from Microsoft Office and Google Docs files as well as instant messaging applications like Whatsapp, <e2>Viber</e2>, Snapchat, etc.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, <e2>Togo</e2>, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (<e2>banking apps</e2>) separately.
Proofpoint wrote about the <e1>DroidJack</e1> RAT side-loaded with the Pokemon GO app back in July 2016; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package. The authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the Super Mario Run game to target eagerly waiting <e2>Android</e2> users.
Last year, researchers discovered two malicious apps, Currency Converter and <e1>BatterySaverMobo</e1>, that were infecting devices with <e2>Anubis</e2> to steal user credentials.
Mandrake Android Malware Stole User Data for Years Undetected <e1>Mandrake</e1>, a malware targeting Android devices, circulated undiscovered for at least four years. The malware’s many capabilities include stealing account credentials, recording activity displayed on the screen, and GPS tracking. The threat actor behind the malware appears to specifically target certain valuable users with the intent to take over their devices and compromise their accounts. The malware is delivered to the device in multiple stages. First, an innocuous mobile app found in the Google Play store is installed on the device. Then, the app tricks the user into granting excessive permissions by displaying what appears to be a request to accept the End-User License Agreement. In the background, however, accepting the agreement grants the app permissions that provide the threat actor with complete control over the device. After the malware is downloaded and steals the desired information, a kill-switch is engaged that wipes any evidence of Mandrake from the device. While the initial targets were located in <e2>Australia</e2>, devices around the world have been compromised.
An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called FakeSpy has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. <e1>FakeSpy</e1>, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and Japan. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, <e2>Germany</e2>, the UK, and the United States.

As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. <e1>Evil Eye</e1> leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass Apple's <e2>iOS</e2> security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia.
Ginning the ratings To implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by <e2>HummingWhale</e2> uses <e1>DroidPlugin</e1>, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company Qihoo 360, Check Point said.
“Given the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code, as well as infrastructure analysis, we are pretty confident that the developer of the <e1>Skygofree</e1> implants is an <e2>Italian IT company</e2> that works on surveillance solutions, just like HackingTeam,” researchers wrote.
Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on <e2>eSurv</e2>. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English).
In a 5-month timespan, actor managed to create a Trojan from scratch which will presumably continue evolving offering new features such as keylogging, back-connect proxy or RAT capabilities. <e1>Ginp</e1>’s unusual target selection is not just about its focus on Spanish banks but also the wide selection of targeted apps per bank. The fact that the overlay screens are almost identical to the legitimate <e2>banking apps</e2> suggests that the actors might be very familiar with the Spanish banking applications and might even be accustomed to the language.
<e1>Skygofree</e1> <e2>Android</e2> malware is ‘one of the most powerful ever seen’ The dangerous new spyware kit can gain total control over an Android device, and it's been in the wild since 2015.
While the malware is currently limited to infecting Japanese and Korean-speaking users, we won't be surprised if it expands its reach given the way <e1>FakeSpy</e1>’s authors actively fine-tune the malware’s configurations. Attack Chain Would-be victims will first receive a mobile text message masquerading as a legitimate message from a Japanese logistics and transportation company urging recipients to click the link in the SMS, as shown in Figure 1. The link will redirect them to the malicious webpage, and clicking any button will prompt users to download an Android application package (APK). The webpage also has a guide, written in Japanese, on how to download and install the app. Further analysis indicates that this campaign also targets <e2>South Korean</e2> users, and has been active since October 2017.
Meanwhile, Google historically has struggled mightily to keep malware off Android devices and apps on the Google Play Store. <e1>Anubis</e1> is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting <e2>financial and banking apps</e2> available for the platform.
HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e2>Gooligan</e2>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at <e1>app.blinkingcamera.com.</e1> Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.

When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, <e2>WeChat</e2>, and WhatsApp) too.

<e1>APT C-23</e1> Hackers Using New Android Spyware Variant to Target <e2>Middle East</e2> Users A threat actor known for striking targets in the Middle East has evolved its Android spyware yet again with enhanced capabilities that allow it to be stealthier and more persistent while passing off as seemingly innocuous app updates to stay under the radar.
<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, <e2>France</e2>, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.
Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1>, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps. In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, <e2>Google</e2>, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.
At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different Spanish banks: Caixa bank, Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, <e2>EVO Banco</e2>, Kutxabank and Santander.

Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and <e2>WhatsApp</e2>) too.
Cerberus embeds the following set of features that allows itself to remain under the radar and successfully perform attacks: Overlaying: Dynamic (Local injects obtained from C2) Keylogging SMS harvesting: SMS listing SMS harvesting: SMS forwarding Device info collection Contact list collection Application listing Location collection Overlaying: Targets list update SMS: Sending Calls: USSD request making Calls: Call forwarding Remote actions: App installing Remote actions: App starting Remote actions: App removal Remote actions: Showing arbitrary web pages Remote actions: Screen-locking Notifications: Push notifications C2 Resilience: Auxiliary C2 list Self-protection: Hiding the App icon Self-protection: Preventing removal Self-protection: Emulation-detection Architecture: Modular Overlay attack Most Android banking Trojans use overlay attacks to trick the victim into providing their personal information (such as but not limited to: credit card information, banking credentials, mail credentials) and <e1>Cerberus</e1> is no exception. In this particular case, the bot abuses the accessibility service privilege to obtain the package name of the foreground application and determine whether or not to show a phishing overlay window, as shown in the following code snippet: Targets Some examples of phishing overlays are shown below. They exist in two types: the credentials stealers (first 2 screenshots) and the credit card grabbers (last screenshot). The only active target list observed in the wild is available in the appendix and contains a total of 30 unique targets. It is interesting to observe that the actual target list contains: 7 French banking apps 7 U.S. banking apps 1 Japanese banking app 15 <e2>non-banking apps</e2> This uncommon target list might either be the result of specific customer demand, or due to some actors having partially reused an existing target list.

Mandrake Android Malware Stole User Data for Years Undetected <e1>Mandrake</e1>, a malware targeting Android devices, circulated undiscovered for at least four years. The malware’s many capabilities include stealing account credentials, recording activity displayed on the screen, and GPS tracking. The threat actor behind the malware appears to specifically target certain valuable users with the intent to take over their devices and compromise their accounts. The malware is delivered to the device in multiple stages. First, an innocuous mobile app found in the <e2>Google Play store</e2> is installed on the device.

Proofpoint wrote about the <e1>DroidJack</e1> RAT side-loaded with the Pokemon GO app back in July 2016; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package. The authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the <e2>Super Mario Run</e2> game to target eagerly waiting Android users.
At least 10 <e1>Pegasus</e1> operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, <e2>Tajikistan</e2>, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.
All this is pretty standard for this type of malware. <e1>Monokle</e1> does have a few other tricks up its sleeve that make it stand out from the crowd, though. It uses Android's accessibility services to capture and exfiltrate information from Microsoft Office and Google Docs files as well as instant messaging applications like <e2>Whatsapp</e2>, Viber, Snapchat, etc.

” Researchers said they collected samples of <e1>Exodus</e1> from 2016 to early 2019. They found that it has a variety of nefarious capabilities, including scooping up call logs and SMS messages, Facebook, Gmail and WhatsApp data and conversations, audio-recording the victim and extracting GPS coordinates of the phone. It can also retrieve a list of installed apps, retrieve the device’s browsing history, extract events from the Calendar app and access the owner’s address book. “All of the victims are located in Italy,” according to Security Without Borders. “All of these <e2>Google Play Store</e2> pages have been taken down by Google.
“At least six countries with significant <e1>Pegasus</e1> operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2>.” The spyware has been abused in this way in the past – in 2017, it was discovered that dozens of Mexican journalists and lawyers (and even a child) had their devices infected by Pegasus in a campaign believed to be carried out by the nation’s government.

The <e1>Red Alert</e1> Payload Once installed, the malware requests Device Administrator privileges. If the malware obtains device administrator rights, it will be able to lock the screen by itself, expire the password, and resist being uninstalled through normal methods. The app then stays in the background listening to commands from the cybercrooks. Within some of the first of those commands, the bot typically receives a list of banks it will target. The Trojan works by creating an overlay whenever the user launches the banking application. Currently Running Applications Banking Trojans that rely on the overlay mechanism to steal information need to know what application is in the foreground. They do this not only to identify whether the use of a particular app may permit them to harvest another credential, but also because each targeted app needs to have an overlay mapped to its design, so the Trojan can intercept and steal user data. This quest to determine the currently running application is a hallmark of overlay malware, so we thought we’d take a closer look at how it’s done. To prevent this, <e2>Android</e2>’s engineers regularly release updates that contain bug fixes designed to prevent apps from getting the list of currently running apps without explicit permission.
What can AnubisSpy do? <e1>AnubisSpy</e1> can steal messages (SMS), photos, videos, contacts, email accounts, calendar events, and browser histories (i.e., Chrome and Samsung Internet Browser). It can also take screenshots and record audio, including calls. It can spy on the victim through apps installed on the device, a list of which is in its configuration file that can be updated. This includes Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, and <e2>Twitter</e2>, among others.

" Google said <e1>Pegasus</e1> never found its way onto the official Play store. But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called Framaroot, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system. Other Android samples may use zero-days, Lookout warned. Google found most targets were located in Israel, though individuals in numerous countries were targeted, including Georgia, <e2>Mexico</e2>, Turkey and the UAE.
Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the <e1>Judy</e1> games had been updated since March this year. The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that "the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected". Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. Ad clicks The apps got past the <e2>Play Store</e2>'s protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code.
<e1>XLoader</e1> Android Spyware and Banking Trojan Distributed via DNS Spoofing We have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early March, which, for now, are targeting Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The attacks use Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing, possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, to distribute and install malicious Android apps. Trend Micro detects these as ANDROIDOS_XLOADER.HRX. These malware pose as legitimate Facebook or Chrome applications. They are distributed from polluted DNS domains that send a notification to an unknowing victim’s device. The malicious apps can steal personally identifiable and financial data and install additional apps. XLoader can also hijack the infected device (i.e., send SMSs) and sports self-protection/persistence mechanisms through device administrator privileges. Infection Chain As with our earlier reports in late March, the attack chain involves diverting internet traffic to attacker-specified domains by compromising and overwriting the router’s DNS settings. A fake alert will notify and urge the user to access the malicious domain and download XLoader. Technical Analysis XLoader first loads the encrypted payload from Assets/db as test.dex to drop the necessary modules then requests for device administrator privileges. Once granted permission, it hides its icon from the launcher application list then starts a service that it keeps running in the background. The background service uses the reflection technique (a feature that allows the inspection and modification of Java-based programs’ internal properties) to invoke the method com.Loader.start in the payload. Monitoring Broadcast Events XLoader registers many broadcast receivers in the payload dynamically (to monitor broadcast events sent between system and applications). Registering broadcast receivers enable XLoader to trigger its malicious routines. Here is a list of broadcast actions: android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE android.net.wifi.SCAN_RESULTS android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REMOVED android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON android.media.RINGER_MODE_CHANGED android.sms.msg.action.SMS_SEND android.sms.msg.action.SMS_DELIVERED Creating a Web Server to Phish XLoader creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events. It can also create a simple HTTP server on the infected device to deceive victims. It shows a web phishing page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event (i.e., if a new package is installed or if the device’s screen is on) to steal personal data, such as those keyed in for banking apps. The phishing page is translated in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English, which are hardcoded in the payload. It will appear differently to users depending on the language set on the device. XLoader as Spyware and Banking Trojan XLoader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device. Its data-stealing capabilities include collecting SMSs after receiving an SMS-related broadcast event and covertly recording phone calls. XLoader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or game-related apps installed on the affected device. XLoader can also start other attacker-specified packages. A possible attack scenario involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions. By monitoring the package installation broadcast event, XLoader can start their packages. This enables it to launch malicious apps without the user’s awareness and explicit consent. We reverse engineered XLoader and found that it appears to target South Korea-based banks and game development companies. XLoader also prevents victims from accessing the device’s settings or using a known antivirus (AV) app in the country. XLoader can also load multiple malicious modules to receive and execute commands from its remote command-and-control (C&C) server, as shown below: Here’s a list of the modules and their functions: sendSms — send SMS/MMS to a specified address setWifi — enable or disable Wi-Fi connection gcont — collect all the device’s contacts lock — currently just an input lock status in the settings (pref) file, but may be used as a screenlocking ransomware bc — collect all contacts from the Android device and SIM card setForward — currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device getForward — currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device hasPkg — check the device whether a specified app is installed or not setRingerMode — set the device’s ringer mode setRecEnable — set the device’s ringer mode as silent reqState — get a detailed phone connection status, which includes activated network and Wi-Fi (with or without password) showHome — force the device’s back to the home screen getnpki: get files/content from the folder named NPKI (contains certificates related to financial transactions) http — access a specified network using HttpURLConnection onRecordAction — simulate a number-dialed tone call — call a specified number get_apps — get all the apps installed on the device show_fs_float_window — show a full-screen window for phishing Of note is XLoader’s abuse of the WebSocket protocol (supported in many browsers and web applications) via ws(WebSockets) or wss(WebSockets over SSL/TLS) to communicate with its C&C servers. The URLs — abused as part of XLoader’s C&C — are hidden in three webpages, and the C&C server that XLoader connects to differ per region. The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time. XLoader abuses the MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission. Mitigations XLoader will not download malicious apps if the Android device uses a mobile data connection. Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router’s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router’s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall. For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats. Everyday users can do the same by checking the router’s DNS settings if they’ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware. We have worked with Google and they ensure that Google Play Protect proactively catches apps of this nature. No instances of these apps were found in Google Play.

Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems. google play malicious apps eSurv Several clues led researchers to pin the spyware on eSurv. First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… <e2>eSurv</e2>’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said.

Monokle and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible.
Something that makes Ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps, first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then stealing the credit card details (to “validate” the user identity), as shown in the screenshots hereafter: Targets The initial version of <e1>Ginp</e1> had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications. Still included in the last versions, this screen is only used to overlay the official Google Play Store app. More apps could be added to the grabber target list in the future, such as the ones that were targeted in older versions: Facebook WhatsApp Skype <e2>Twitter</e2> Chrome Instagram Snapchat Viber The following screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay screen: Based on Anubis Once the Anubis bot code got leaked, it was just a matter of time before new banking Trojans based on Anubis would surface.

<e1>Red Alert</e1> Android Trojan for Rent at $500 Per Month It is also capable of stealing information from the infected devices, including SMS messages and contact details, can block calls from banks, and can also keep in touch with bots via Twitter in the event its command and control (C&C) server is taken online. When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, <e2>Poker Stars</e2>, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.
Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called <e2>eSurv</e2>. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in Calabria, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems.

[CLS] In early July, <e1>Avast</e1> researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. "Despite Cerberus' Russian speaking developers earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team," Kaspersky says. "Due to an unclear culmination of factors, the author later decided to publish the project source code for premium users on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum." The cybersecurity firm says that following the free release of Cerberus source code in the underground, there was an "immediate rise" in mobile app infections across Europe and <e2>Russia</e2>. Of particular note, Galov says, is that previous clients were not encouraged to strike Russian mobile device users -- but the moment the code was released, the attack landscape changed. [SEP]
[CLS] How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top <e2>social media apps</e2> vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named Eventbot, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.

[CLS] Facebook disrupts hackers who used iOS exploits, malware to spy on Uyghurs Facebook on Wednesday said it successfully cut off a hacking operation that used the social media platform to spread the so-called <e1>Insomnia</e1> malware, a malicious program leveraged in an effort to spy on Uyghur Muslims from Xinjiang, China. Announced in a blog post, Facebook's action targeted a group of hackers known in the security community as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the Chinese government, deployed iOS and Android malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents. Uyghurs from Xinjiang who moved abroad were the main target of the group's activities. As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. Evil Eye leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass Apple's iOS security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia. In addition to watering hole attacks, the group used fake Facebook accounts to build trust with targets before prompting them to click on malicious links, Facebook said. "On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself," Mike Dvilyanski, head of Facebook's cyber espionage investigations, and Nathaniel Gleicher, head of the company's security policy, said the post. "We saw this activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies' actions to disrupt their activity." As detailed in a report from security firm Volexity last year, Insomnia worked on any web browser running in all versions of iOS 10 and 11, as well as iOS 12.0, 12.1, 12.3, 12.3.1 and iOS 12.3.2. Once installed, the malware granted access to a user's Contacts, location, Messages data, and information from third-party apps. <e2>Apple</e2> patched the offending WebKit flaw in iOS 12. [SEP]
[CLS] It targeted a Mexican journalist and <e2>UAE</e2> activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers. The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as <e1>Chrysaor</e1>, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. [SEP]
[CLS] Ginp - A malware patchwork borrowing from <e1>Anubis</e1> Intro ThreatFabric analysts have recently investigated an interesting new strain of banking malware. The malware was first spotted by Tatyana Shishkova from Kaspersky by end October 2019, but actually dates back to June 2019. It is still under active development, with at least 5 different versions of the Trojan released within the last 5 months (June - November 2019). What makes Ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware. In addition, its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on Spanish banks. Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then their credit card details. Although multi-step overlays are not something new, their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion. Evolution The initial version of the malware dates back to early June 2019, masquerading as a “Google Play Verificator” app. At that time, Ginp was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, <e2>Instagram</e2> and Twitter. [SEP]
[CLS] MazarBOT Android Malware Distributed via SMS Spoofing Campaign In the fall of 2015, <e2>Heimdal Security</e2> detected a post-office email scam targeting unsuspecting Danish users. The campaign sent out fake emails purporting to originate from PostNord and Post Denmark. When clicked on, the infected emails downloaded Cryptolocker2 ransomware onto users’ machines. Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and Denmark, including Post Denmark. This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as MazarBOT. Heimdal explains in a blog post that the campaign begins with the following SMS message: In English, the text message reads: “Your package is available for pick up. Follow link to see all the information on your package.” Clicking on the shortened link leads to www[.]fhsinsaat.com/apk/post.apk, a URL which downloads the infected Android installation application file for MazarBOT. Security researchers at real-time threat intelligence firm <e1>Recorded Future</e1> first detected the Android malware back in November of 2015. [SEP]

[CLS] The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; <e1>NSO</e1>’s clients weren’t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as Chrysaor — that’s what Google calls it. The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that’s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in <e2>Israel</e2>, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. [SEP]
[CLS] In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) <e2>botnet</e2> and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named <e1>Eventbot</e1>, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication. [SEP]
[CLS] A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware.

There have been several incidents within, <e2>2020</e2> when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. [SEP]
[CLS] Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the <e1>Judy</e1> games had been updated since March this year. The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that "the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected". Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. Ad clicks The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code. Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts. This kind of delivery "has become commonplace", Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in Networking at the Open University, told the <e2>BBC</e2>. "There are many tools available, and the advantage is that the malware distributor can change them remotely, which makes it difficult for anti-malware software to keep up. [SEP]
[CLS] Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, <e2>France</e2>, Germany, the UK, and the United States. The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn’t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user’s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user’s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information. As to where the malware originated from, researchers claim that all signs point to a Chinese group known as “Roaming Mantis.” <e1>Cybereason</e1> concludes: The malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped. [SEP]
[CLS] Meanwhile, <e1>Google</e1> historically has struggled mightily to keep malware off Android devices and apps on the Google Play Store. Anubis is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting financial and banking apps available for the platform. Last year, researchers discovered two malicious apps, Currency Converter and BatterySaverMobo, that were infecting devices with Anubis to steal user credentials. At the time, researchers noted the trojan had been distributed to 93 different countries, targeting the users of 377 variations of financial apps to farm account details. Previous to that, IBM’s <e2>X-Force</e2> team spotted Anubis in a campaign that used 10 malicious downloaders disguised as various Google Play applications to fetch the mobile banking trojan and run it on Android devices.

[CLS] After the actor behind RedAlert 2 decided to quit the rental business, we observed a surge in <e1>Anubis</e1> samples in the wild. After the Anubis actor was allegedly arrested and the source code was leaked there was also huge increase in the number of Anubis samples found in the wild, but the new actors using Anubis have no support or updates. Due to this Cerberus will come in handy for actors that want to focus on performing fraud without having to develop and maintain a botnet and C2 infrastructure. Analysis of evasion techniques Along with the standard payload and string obfuscation, Cerberus uses a rather interesting technique to prevent analysis of the Trojan. Using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim. The idea is simple - if the infected device belongs to a real person, sooner or later this person will move around, increasing the step counter. The Trojan uses this counter to activate the bot - if aforementioned step counter hits the pre-configured threshold it considers running on the device to be safe. This simple measure prevents the Trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments (sandboxes) and on the test devices of malware analysts. The code responsible for this verification is shown in the following snippet: How it works When the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer. Then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot: After the user grants the requested privilege, Cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions, such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls, without requiring any user interaction. It also disables <e2>Play Protect</e2> (Google’s preinstalled antivirus solution) to prevent its discovery and deletion in the future. [SEP]
[CLS] We have found another instance of malware posing as the Super Mario Run Android app, and this time it has taken the form of <e1>DroidJack</e1> RAT (remote access trojan). Proofpoint wrote about the DroidJack RAT side-loaded with the Pokemon GO app back in July 2016; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package. The authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the Super Mario Run game to target eagerly waiting Android users. Details: Name : Super Mario Run Package Name : net.droidjack.server MD5 : 69b4b32e4636f1981841cbbe3b927560 Technical Analysis: The malicious package claims to be the Super Mario Run game, as shown in the permissions screenshot below, but in reality this is a malicious RAT called DroidJack (also known as SandroRAT) that is getting installed. DroidJack RAT starts capturing sensitive information like call data, SMS data, videos, photos, etc. Observe below the code routine for call recording. This RAT records all the calls and stores the recording to an “.amr” file. The following is the code routine for video capturing. Here, the RAT stores all the captured videos in a “video.3gp” file. It also harvests call details and SMS logs as shown below. Upon further inspection, we have observed that this RAT extracts WhatsApp data too. The RAT stores all the data in a database (DB) in order to send it to the Command & Control (C&C) server. The following are the DBs created and maintained by the RAT. We saw the following hardcoded C&C server location in the RAT package: Conclusion: The DroidJack RAT is another example of a growing trend in which malware authors seek to exploit public interest as a way to spread malware.

All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as Chrysaor — that’s what Google calls it. The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that’s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. Pegasus for Android was also spotted in <e2>Turkey</e2>, Kenya, Nigeria, UAE, and other countries. [SEP]

[CLS] Speaking at <e2>Kaspersky NEXT 2020</e2> on Wednesday, Kaspersky cybersecurity researcher Dmitry Galov said that the leaked code, distributed under the name Cerberus v2, presents an increased threat for smartphone users and the banking sector at large. Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections. OTPs generated through Google Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. "Despite Cerberus' <e1>Russian speaking developers</e1> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team," Kaspersky says.

[CLS] Researchers from The Citizen Lab scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company <e1>NSO Group</e1> as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an <e2>Amnesty International</e2> staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018.

The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as Chrysaor, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. Like the iPhone version, the Android Pegasus had some advanced features: it could be controlled via SMS and self-destruct if required.

At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, <e2>Oman</e2>, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

[CLS] <e2>Virulent</e2> Android malware returns, gets >2 million downloads on Google Play A virulent family of malware that infected more than 10 million Android devices last year has made a comeback, this time hiding inside Google Play apps that have been downloaded by as many as 12 million unsuspecting users. HummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. HummingBad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars. "This malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden, meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device." As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of <e1>HummingWhale</e1> is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps. [SEP]

[CLS] A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named <e2>Eventbot</e2>, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.

[CLS] Meanwhile, <e1>Google</e1> historically has struggled mightily to keep malware off Android devices and apps on the Google Play Store. Anubis is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting financial and banking apps available for the platform. Last year, researchers discovered two malicious apps, Currency Converter and BatterySaverMobo, that were infecting devices with Anubis to steal user credentials. At the time, researchers noted the trojan had been distributed to 93 different countries, targeting the users of 377 variations of financial apps to farm account details. Previous to that, <e2>IBM</e2>’s X-Force team spotted Anubis in a campaign that used 10 malicious downloaders disguised as various Google Play applications to fetch the mobile banking trojan and run it on Android devices. [SEP]
[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, <e2>Kyrgyzstan</e2>, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

[CLS] Another cybersecurity firm, <e2>Zerodium</e2>, once offered $1 million for an iOS zero-day, so you can imagine that it cost quite a bit of money to create Pegasus. As for surveillance, let’s be clear: We’re talking total surveillance. Pegasus is modular malware. After scanning the target’s device, it installs the necessary modules to read the user’s messages and mail, listen to calls, capture screenshots, log pressed keys, exfiltrate browser history, contacts, and so on and so forth. Basically, it can spy on every aspect of the target’s life. It’s also noteworthy that Pegasus could even listen to encrypted audio streams and read encrypted messages — thanks to its keylogging and audio recording capabilities, it was stealing messages before they were encrypted (and, for incoming messages, after decryption). Another interesting fact about Pegasus is that it tries to hide itself really diligently. The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; NSO’s clients weren’t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as Chrysaor — that’s what <e1>Google</e1> calls it.

[CLS] Cybercriminals typically use third-party app marketplaces to distribute their malicious apps, but in operations such as the ones that distributed CPUMINER, BankBot, and <e1>MilkyDoor</e1>, they would try to get their apps published on Google Play or App Store. We’ve also seen others take a more subtle approach that involves SmiShing to direct potential victims to malicious pages. Case in point: a campaign we recently observed that uses SMS as an entry point to deliver an information stealer we called FakeSpy (Trend Micro detects this threat ANDROIDOS_FAKESPY.HRX). FakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and call records stored in the infected device. FakeSpy can also serve as a vector for a banking trojan (ANDROIDOS_LOADGFISH.HRX). While the malware is currently limited to infecting Japanese and Korean-speaking users, we won't be surprised if it expands its reach given the way FakeSpy’s authors actively fine-tune the malware’s configurations. Attack Chain Would-be victims will first receive a mobile text message masquerading as a legitimate message from a Japanese logistics and transportation company urging recipients to click the link in the SMS, as shown in Figure 1. The link will redirect them to the malicious webpage, and clicking any button will prompt users to download an Android application package (APK). The webpage also has a guide, written in Japanese, on how to download and install the app. Further analysis indicates that this campaign also targets <e2>South Korean</e2> users, and has been active since October 2017.

[CLS] Virulent Android malware returns, gets >2 million downloads on Google Play A virulent family of malware that infected more than 10 million Android devices last year has made a comeback, this time hiding inside Google Play apps that have been downloaded by as many as 12 million unsuspecting users. <e2>HummingWhale,</e2> as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. HummingBad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars. "This malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden, meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device."

[CLS] Researchers from The Citizen Lab scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company <e1>NSO Group</e1> as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.” The spyware has been abused in this way in the past – in 2017, it was discovered that dozens of Mexican journalists and lawyers (and even a child) had their devices infected by Pegasus in a campaign believed to be carried out by the nation’s government. <e2>Marczak</e2>, for his part, told us that the spyware’s civil rights abuse is a sign of what’s to come: “Civil society will increasingly find itself the target of this type of sophisticated surveillance unless the governments better regulate the spyware industry,” he said.

[CLS] Google Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. <e1>Pegasus for iPhone</e1> was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers. The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as Chrysaor, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. Like the iPhone version, the Android Pegasus had some advanced features: it could be controlled via SMS and self-destruct if required. The "highly advanced" tool was also able to grab large amounts of comms data, pilfering messages and call records from WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and <e2>Gmail</e2>, amongst others, Lookout noted in its report released Monday.

[CLS] HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 <e2>Google Play apps</e2> that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars. "This malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden, meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device." As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of HummingWhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps. When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine. That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues. Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate Google Play. It has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device. Until now, Android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities. Ginning the ratings To implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by HummingWhale uses DroidPlugin, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company <e1>Qihoo 360</e1>, Check Point said.

[CLS] The URLs — abused as part of XLoader’s C&C — are hidden in three webpages, and the C&C server that <e2>XLoader</e2> connects to differ per region. The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time. XLoader abuses the MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission. Mitigations XLoader will not download malicious apps if the Android device uses a mobile data connection. Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router’s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router’s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall. For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats. Everyday users can do the same by checking the router’s DNS settings if they’ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware. We have worked with Google and they ensure that Google Play Protect proactively catches apps of this nature. No instances of these apps were found in Google Play.

[CLS] Anubis Malware Upgrade Logs When Victims Look at Their Screens Threat actors are cooking up new features for the sophisticated banking trojan that targets <e1>Google</e1> Android apps and devices. The Anubis malware, which threat actors use to persistently attack Google’s Android-based smartphones, is set to evolve once again, this time adding a feature that allows the malware to identify if a victim is looking at his or her screen. The new feature is one of several that haven’t been released in the wild yet but are a part of an updated control panel for the malware that’s currently in development, researchers from security consulting firm Hold Security discovered, according to a report published online. The panel is a web-based module that explores devices that have already been infiltrated by Anubis, researchers said. Threat actors use it to view and decide from which device they want to steal data as well as which services on devices to target. The new control panel will add features that provide even more insight so attackers can fully take advantage of a device, Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security, told <e2>Bank Info Security</e2>. One key addition to the malware is a small eyeball icon included in the control panel that can be used to recognize whether a user of a device with Anubis installed is looking at the device or not.

They also state that the code is written from scratch and is not using parts of other existing banking Trojans unlike many other Trojans that are either based completely on the source of another Trojan (such as the leaked Anubis source code that is now being resold) or at least borrow parts of other Trojans. After thorough analysis we can confirm that Cerberus was indeed not based on the Anubis source code.

[CLS] <e1>APT C-23</e1> Hackers Using New Android Spyware Variant to Target Middle East Users A threat actor known for striking targets in the Middle East has evolved its Android spyware yet again with enhanced capabilities that allow it to be stealthier and more persistent while passing off as seemingly innocuous app updates to stay under the radar. The new variants have "incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains," Sophos threat researcher Pankaj Kohli said in a report published Tuesday. Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps. In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as <e2>Chrome</e2>, Google, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.

[CLS] 0 includes <e1>NatWest</e1>, Barclays, Westpac, and Citibank. Red Alert 2.0 is a banking bot that is currently very active online, and presents a risk to Android devices. We expect to see more diversification in the social engineering lures this threat group employs as time goes on. So far, legitimate app stores appear to be this malware’s Achilles heel; disabling the installation of third-party apps has been an effective prevention measure. Stick to Google Play and use VPN software from reputable vendors. <e2>Sophos</e2> detects all the samples of this Trojan family as Andr/Banker-GWC and Andr/Spybot-A. [SEP]
[CLS] This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told <e1>Threatpost</e1>. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2>.” The spyware has been abused in this way in the past – in 2017, it was discovered that dozens of Mexican journalists and lawyers (and even a child) had their devices infected by Pegasus in a campaign believed to be carried out by the nation’s government.

[CLS] OTPs generated through <e2>Google Authenticator</e2> may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. "Despite Cerberus' <e1>Russian speaking developers</e1> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team," Kaspersky says. [SEP]
[CLS] The campaign sent out fake emails purporting to originate from <e1>PostNord</e1> and Post Denmark. When clicked on, the infected emails downloaded Cryptolocker2 ransomware onto users’ machines. Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and Denmark, including <e2>Post Denmark</e2>. This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as MazarBOT. [SEP]
[CLS] HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. <e1>Gooligan</e1>, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor <e2>Lookout</e2> also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. [SEP]
[CLS] After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as <e1>Chrysaor</e1> — that’s what Google calls it. The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that’s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and <e2>Mexico</e2> third. [SEP]

Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too. <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> is also advertised as able to intercept and send SMS messages and launch APKs.

[CLS] Since first tracking its activity in 2019, the sophistication of Cerberus has been elevated to new levels of functionality, in much the same way as <e1>Anubis</e1> – another Android banking malware example which went public in late 2019 to the detriment of customers and banks themselves. Kaspersky is in the process of investigating ‘v2’ further, having obtained the published archive which included the revealed source code. In-depth analysis of the infrastructure has already unearthed the malware’s ability to covertly send and steal SMS codes, to open tailored overlays for various online banks, and to steal 2FA-codes including from <e2>Google Authenticator</e2>. Additional capabilities include accessing customer credit card and contact details, the ability to redirect calls or tamper with mobile functionality via its RAT features, and to automatically grant required permissions as part of its authentication attributes.

[CLS] More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, Kiniwini, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name <e1>Enistudio</e1>. The games, all of which feature a character called Judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times. 'Hid undetected' The malicious code was also found in several apps from other developers. "It is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly," said Check Point. Between them, the infected apps may have been downloaded up to 36.5 million times. Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the Judy games had been updated since March this year. The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that "the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected". Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. Ad clicks The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, <e2>Google Bouncer</e2>, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code. [SEP]

[CLS] Cerberus - A new banking Trojan from the underworld August 2019 Intro In June 2019, <e2>ThreatFabric</e2> analysts found a new Android malware, dubbed “Cerberus”, being rented out on underground forums. Its authors claim that it was used for private operations for two years preceding the start of the rental. They also state that the code is written from scratch and is not using parts of other existing banking Trojans unlike many other Trojans that are either based completely on the source of another Trojan (such as the leaked <e1>Anubis</e1> source code that is now being resold) or at least borrow parts of other Trojans. [SEP]
[CLS] ” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the <e2>UAE</e2>, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia. Interestingly the research team found several infections in United States IP space – but the Pegasus customers were not linked to the United States, indicating cross-border compromise. When The Citizen Lab presented their findings to NSO Group, the company released a statement: “There are multiple problems with Citizen Lab’s latest report. Most significantly, the list of countries in which <e1>NSO</e1> is alleged to operate is simply inaccurate. [SEP]
[CLS] The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the <e1>Chinese government</e1>, deployed iOS and Android malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents. Uyghurs from Xinjiang who moved abroad were the main target of the group's activities. As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. Evil Eye leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass Apple's iOS security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia. In addition to watering hole attacks, the group used fake Facebook accounts to build trust with targets before prompting them to click on malicious links, Facebook said. "On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself," Mike Dvilyanski, head of Facebook's cyber espionage investigations, and Nathaniel Gleicher, head of the company's security policy, said the post. "We saw this activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies' actions to disrupt their activity." As detailed in a report from security firm <e2>Volexity</e2> last year, Insomnia worked on any web browser running in all versions of iOS 10 and 11, as well as iOS 12. [SEP]
[CLS] DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In <e2>May 2020</e2>, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named Eventbot, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication. In March 2020, McAfee Mobile Research team observed an Android malware dubbed <e1>Android/LeifAccess.A</e1> that abused OAuth leveraging accessibility services to infect Android devices and post fake reviews on Google Play.

[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, <e2>Turkey</e2>, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

[CLS] Google Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile <e2>spyware</e2> created by NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. Pegasus for iPhone was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers. The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as <e1>Chrysaor</e1>, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. [SEP]
[CLS] According to the company’s website, it offers a wide range of app development, pen testing and cybersecurity consulting services. <e1>Kaspersky Lab</e1> said Skygofree victims were likely infected via malicious redirects or man-in-the-middle attacks driving users to landing pages that mimic mobile carrier web sites. Those landing pages included similar domain names and web page content to wireless carriers. Once targets were lured to landing page sites they were prompted to update their phone’s software. “Dear Customer, in order to avoid malfunctions to your internet connection, we encourage you to upgrade your configuration. Download the update now and keep on navigating at maximum speed,” read one fake landing page targeting Vodafone customers. Researchers describe Skygofree as a complex system capable of a wide range of spying, similar to Pegasus discovered in August 2016. Pegasus was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the NSO Group. Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident. Kaspersky Lab said in the case of Skygofree, it was only aware of a handful of users in <e2>Italy</e2> being targeted with the malware. [SEP]
[CLS] The new feature is one of several that haven’t been released in the wild yet but are a part of an updated control panel for the malware that’s currently in development, researchers from security consulting firm <e2>Hold Security</e2> discovered, according to a report published online. The panel is a web-based module that explores devices that have already been infiltrated by Anubis, researchers said. Threat actors use it to view and decide from which device they want to steal data as well as which services on devices to target. The new control panel will add features that provide even more insight so attackers can fully take advantage of a device, Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security, told <e1>Bank Info Security</e1>. One key addition to the malware is a small eyeball icon included in the control panel that can be used to recognize whether a user of a device with Anubis installed is looking at the device or not. [SEP]
[CLS] When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A <e1>Trustwave</e1> report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, <e2>New Zeeland</e2>, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. [SEP]
[CLS] They also state that the code is written from scratch and is not using parts of other existing banking Trojans unlike many other Trojans that are either based completely on the source of another <e2>Trojan</e2> (such as the leaked Anubis source code that is now being resold) or at least borrow parts of other Trojans. After thorough analysis we can confirm that Cerberus was indeed not based on the Anubis source code. One peculiar thing about the actor group behind this banking malware is that they have an “official” twitter account that they use to post promotional content (even videos) about the malware. Oddly enough they also use it to make fun of the AV community, sharing detection screenshots from VirusTotal (thus leaking IoC) and even engaging in discussions with malware researchers directly. The following screenshot shows tweets from their advertisement campaign: That unusual behavior could be explained by the combination of the need for attention and a probable lack of experience. What is sure is that the gap in the Android banking malware rental business left open after the rental of the Anubis 2 and <e1>RedAlert 2</e1> Trojans ended provides a good opportunity for the actors behind Cerberus to grow their business quickly.

[CLS] Cyberespionage Campaign Sphinx Goes Mobile With AnubisSpy <e2>Android</e2> malware like ransomware exemplify how the platform can be lucrative for cybercriminals. But there are also other threats stirring up as of late: attacks that spy on and steal data from specific targets, crossing over between desktops and mobile devices. Take for instance several malicious apps we came across with cyberespionage capabilities, which were targeting Arabic-speaking users or Middle Eastern countries. These were published on Google Play — but have since been taken down — and third-party app marketplaces. We named these malicious apps AnubisSpy (ANDROIDOS_ANUBISSPY) as all the malware’s payload is a package called watchdog.

[CLS] Meet Monokle, an Android Malware Family Capable of Stealing and Changing Passwords <e1>Special Technology Center (STC</e1>) is a software development company based in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the American Government hasn't been particularly happy with it. In 2016, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on STC because his administration believed that it was one of the three companies that helped the Russian government interfere with the USA's 2016 presidential elections. It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for STC, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called Monokle. Monokle and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible. Lookout's experts think, however, that there is plenty of evidence linking Monokle to STC. According to Lookout's technical report, STC is in the business of developing, among other things, a suite of defensive products for Android devices which is allegedly sold exclusively to Russian government agencies. The company also has a control panel application called <e2>App Control</e2> through which the rest of STC's services are managed. [SEP]

Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as <e1>Chrysaor</e1>, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers from The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company NSO Group as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, <e2>Morocco</e2>, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. [SEP]
[CLS] In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and <e2>Japan</e2>. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, Germany, the UK, and the United States. The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn’t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user’s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user’s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information. As to where the malware originated from, researchers claim that all signs point to a Chinese group known as “Roaming Mantis.” <e1>Cybereason</e1> concludes: The malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped.

[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, <e2>Egypt</e2>, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

[CLS] <e1>Google</e1> Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. Pegasus for iPhone was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers.

[CLS] An old piece of Android malware is back and more dangerous than before An old and dangerous piece of Android malware called <e1>FakeSpy</e1> has resurfaced in a big way, according to a new report from Cybereason. FakeSpy, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more. In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and Japan. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, Germany, the UK, and the United States.

[CLS] Backdoor Commands The <e2>Red Alert</e2> code also contains an embedded list of commands the botmaster can send to the bot. The malware can execute a variety of arbitrary commands, including (for example) intercepting or sending text messages without the user’s knowledge, obtaining a copy of the victim’s Address Book, or call or text message logs, or sending phone network feature codes (also known as USSD codes). C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app’s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we’ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we’ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we’ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on port 7878/tcp. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a Twitter account. Static analysis of the code reveals that the malware downloads the overlay template to use against any of the bank(s) it is targeting. The malware also sends regular telemetry back to its C2 server about the infected device in the form of an HTTP POST to its C2 server. It uses the base Dalvik User-Agent string for the device it’s running on. The list of banks targeted by Red Alert 2.0 includes NatWest, Barclays, Westpac, and Citibank. Red Alert 2.0 is a banking bot that is currently very active online, and presents a risk to Android devices. We expect to see more diversification in the social engineering lures this threat group employs as time goes on. So far, legitimate app stores appear to be this malware’s Achilles heel; disabling the installation of third-party apps has been an effective prevention measure. Stick to Google Play and use VPN software from reputable vendors. Sophos detects all the samples of this Trojan family as Andr/Banker-GWC and <e1>Andr/Spybot-A</e1>.

Due to an unclear culmination of factors, the author later decided to publish the project source code for premium users on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum. The result has been an immediate rise in mobile application infections and attempts to steal money from consumers in Russia and across Europe, as more and more cybercriminals acquire the malware for free. Since first tracking its activity in 2019, the sophistication of Cerberus has been elevated to new levels of functionality, in much the same way as <e1>Anubis</e1> – another Android banking malware example which went public in late 2019 to the detriment of customers and banks themselves.

The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as Chrysaor, with Google, just as it collaborated with the University of Toronto's <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. [SEP]
[CLS] “All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian.” <e2>Security Without Borders</e2> told Threatpost that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to Google Play – and while Google did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand. Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. <e1>eSurv</e1> Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv.

[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, <e2>Thailand</e2>, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections.

In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords.

[CLS] APT C-23 Hackers Using New Android <e2>Spyware</e2> Variant to Target Middle East Users A threat actor known for striking targets in the Middle East has evolved its Android spyware yet again with enhanced capabilities that allow it to be stealthier and more persistent while passing off as seemingly innocuous app updates to stay under the radar. The new variants have "incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains," Sophos threat researcher Pankaj Kohli said in a report published Tuesday. Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, <e1>GnatSpy</e1>, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

Clues as to who is behind the malware trace back to the Italian firm Negg International. Researchers said domains used for landing pages to spread the malware were registered to the company. Negg International did not return requests for comment. According to the company’s website, it offers a wide range of app development, pen testing and cybersecurity consulting services. Kaspersky Lab said Skygofree victims were likely infected via malicious redirects or man-in-the-middle attacks driving users to landing pages that mimic mobile carrier web sites. Those landing pages included similar domain names and web page content to wireless carriers. Once targets were lured to landing page sites they were prompted to update their phone’s software. “Dear Customer, in order to avoid malfunctions to your internet connection, we encourage you to upgrade your configuration. Download the update now and keep on navigating at maximum speed,” read one fake landing page targeting Vodafone customers.

First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to “garbage” in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. “Many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv… eSurv’s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,” researchers said. eSurv’s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down. According to Italian media reports, meanwhile, Giuseppe Fasano, owner of eSurv, and Salvatore Ansani, manager of eSurv, are currently under investigation by Italian authorities regarding the spyware. Google Play Despite several publicized efforts to prevent malicious apps, the Google Play consumer store has continued to see bad apps cropping up on its platform over the past year. Just in this past January, Google Play removed two malicious apps that were infecting devices with a notorious banking malware bent on harvesting victims’ credentials. Also, last month an Android spyware dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims’ phones, mainly via Google Play. Also, early last year, Google removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights and call recorders to WiFi signal boosters, which together were downloaded at least 7.5 million times from the Google Play marketplace. Researchers said that Google Play told them that: “thanks to enhanced detection models, <e2>Google Play Protect</e2> will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications. [SEP]

[CLS] The "highly advanced" tool was also able to grab large amounts of comms data, pilfering messages and call records from WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, <e1>Skype</e1> and Gmail, amongst others, Lookout noted in its report released Monday. It could also control the camera and microphone, as well as carry out keylogging and take screenshots. The "suicide" self-destruct feature was particularly devilish, helping NSO Group's malware avoid detection for almost three years. "If it feels like it's going to be found, it removes itself," said Lookout mobile security researcher Michael Flossman. "That's why it took so long to find these samples." Lookout and Google said that though the samples date from 2014, there was evidence the spyware was working on some victim Android phones when discovered in the last few months. All known targets have been alerted. While the iOS version removed itself if it detected a jailbreak, the Android tool would delete if it couldn't contact command and control servers for a set period of time. Or if certain tools, revealed by "antidote files," that could detect the malware were spied by Pegasus, it would disappear. One of the samples, aimed at Samsung phones, removed the manufacturer's system update app to prevent security fixes from disrupting its snooping. Flossman believes that Pegasus for Android was delivered in a similar fashion to its iPhone equivalent, via an SMS message. "The various exploits contained in this surveillance-ware would attempt to be run once the app was installed," Flossman said. "If these exploits were patched on the target device, Pegasus would still be able to function but with a reduced set of capabilities." Google said Pegasus never found its way onto the official Play store. But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called <e2>Framaroot</e2>, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system.

[CLS] Several months later, <e1>Heimdal</e1> has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and Denmark, including Post Denmark. This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as MazarBOT. Heimdal explains in a blog post that the campaign begins with the following SMS message: In English, the text message reads: “Your package is available for pick up. Follow link to see all the information on your package.” Clicking on the shortened link leads to www[.]fhsinsaat.com/apk/post.apk, a URL which downloads the infected Android installation application file for MazarBOT. Security researchers at real-time threat intelligence firm Recorded Future first detected the Android malware back in November of 2015. They found MazarBOT for sale on an underground web market. At the time, there was no indication any real-life malware campaigns were actively distributing MazarBOT. That has since changed. In February, news broke of a malware campaign infecting users with MazarBOT. The malware spread via SMS texts that asked users to click on a link in order to view a multimedia message. That link, in turn, loaded the malware’s APK file. Once it has been fully downloaded onto a computer, MazarBOT has the ability to open, monitor and control backdoors on the victim’s Android device; send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, which will increase the victim’s mobile phone bill; read SMS messages, including two-step verification codes; use the “Polipo proxy” to launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks; and inject itself in the mobile Google Chrome browser.

[CLS] Cyberespionage Campaign <e1>Sphinx</e1> Goes Mobile With AnubisSpy Android malware like ransomware exemplify how the platform can be lucrative for cybercriminals. But there are also other threats stirring up as of late: attacks that spy on and steal data from specific targets, crossing over between desktops and mobile devices. Take for instance several malicious apps we came across with cyberespionage capabilities, which were targeting Arabic-speaking users or Middle Eastern countries. These were published on Google Play — but have since been taken down — and third-party app marketplaces. We named these malicious apps AnubisSpy (ANDROIDOS_ANUBISSPY) as all the malware’s payload is a package called watchdog. We construe AnubisSpy to be linked to the cyberespionage campaign Sphinx (APT-C-15) based on shared file structures and command-and-control (C&C) server as well as targets. It’s also possible that while AnubisSpy’s operators may also be Sphinx’s, they could be running separate but similar campaigns. What can AnubisSpy do? AnubisSpy can steal messages (SMS), photos, videos, contacts, email accounts, calendar events, and browser histories (i.e., Chrome and Samsung Internet Browser). It can also take screenshots and record audio, including calls. It can spy on the victim through apps installed on the device, a list of which is in its configuration file that can be updated. This includes Skype, WhatsApp, <e2>Facebook</e2>, and Twitter, among others. [SEP]
[CLS] It uses Android's accessibility services to capture and exfiltrate information from Microsoft Office and Google Docs files as well as instant messaging applications like Whatsapp, <e2>Viber</e2>, Snapchat, etc. It can make screen recordings even when the device is still locked, which means that it can capture the password, PIN code, or pattern used to unlock the device. Once it has captured the secret, it can change it and lock people out of their phones or tablets. Perhaps the most advanced feature, however, is the ability to install trusted certificates on compromised devices. Thanks to it, a Man-in-The-Middle attack against TLS traffic is possible. All in all, Monokle isn't something you want to have on your Android device. The good news is, most of you are unlikely to encounter it. Monokle is aimed at specific targets The earliest sample Lookout examined dates back to 2015, but Monokle is still being used in attacks to this day. As with most Android malware families, the primary infection vector comes in the form of trojanized apps distributed on third-party app stores. Most of them impersonate real applications, and some even come with legitimate functionality, which can make detection more difficult. Based on the titles and the icons of the malicious apps, the experts concluded that Monokle is used in highly targeted attacks against specific sets of users. Some of the applications were clearly designed to catch the attention of people associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria. Others were aimed at users situated in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, and a third group targeted people situated in the Caucasus region of Eastern Europe. If what Lookout's experts say is true, Monokle is most likely used by <e1>Russian government agencies</e1> which are trying to spy on particular individuals. [SEP]

[CLS] APT C-23 Hackers Using New Android Spyware Variant to Target <e2>Middle East</e2> Users A threat actor known for striking targets in the Middle East has evolved its Android spyware yet again with enhanced capabilities that allow it to be stealthier and more persistent while passing off as seemingly innocuous app updates to stay under the radar. The new variants have "incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains," Sophos threat researcher Pankaj Kohli said in a report published Tuesday. Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, <e1>GnatSpy</e1>, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, <e2>Tunisia</e2>, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine. That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues. Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate Google Play. It has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device. Until now, Android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities. Ginning the ratings To implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by HummingWhale uses DroidPlugin, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company <e1>Qihoo 360</e1>, Check Point said.

[CLS] Android Accessibility Services Vulnerable to Android Malware <e1>Defensor ID</e1> Android Accessibility Services has been caught with unexpected consequences as hackers are creating sneaky malware to use this service for malicious intents and to interact with the system’s interface and applications. A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, <e2>2020</e2> when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers describe Skygofree as a complex system capable of a wide range of spying, similar to <e1>Pegasus</e1> discovered in August 2016. Pegasus was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the NSO Group. Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident. Kaspersky Lab said in the case of Skygofree, it was only aware of a handful of users in Italy being targeted with the malware. Those Italian links have also prompted comparison between Skygofree and Italy-based intrusion software vendor HackingTeam. HackingTeam is known for selling surveillance and intrusion software products designed to help law enforcement agencies and other customers perform remote penetration and control of target systems. “Given the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code, as well as infrastructure analysis, we are pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like HackingTeam,” researchers wrote.

[CLS] Dvmap – The First Android-Rooting Malware With Code Injection Ability Found In Google Play Store Security Researchers at <e2>Kaspersky Lab</e2> observed a new rooting malware being distributed through the Google Play Store. Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries. Kaspersky Lab products detect it as Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a. The distribution of rooting malware through Google Play is not a new thing. For example, the Ztorg Trojan has been uploaded to Google Play Store almost 100 times since September 2016. But Dvmap is a unique rooting malware because it uses a variety of new techniques. The most interesting thing, as stated above, is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries, such as libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so. The Dvmap malware is designed to specifically target Android Smart Phone users. The technique used to distribute the malware via Google Play Store were quite unique. The malware (Dvmap) was uploaded to Google Play Store masked as several simple apps such as Puzzle Games.

The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild."

[CLS] Potent <e1>Skygofree</e1> Malware Packs ‘Never-Before-Seen’ Features Researchers have identified a powerful new Android malware strain called Skygofree capable of eavesdropping on WhatsApp messages, siphoning private data off phones and allowing adversaries to open reverse shell modules on targeted devices, giving attackers ultimate remote control. Researchers said the malware was developed three years ago and has evolved significantly since then to include 48 unique commands in it most recent iteration. Several of those features have never been seen before in Android malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the Skygofree strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers <e2>Nikita Buchka</e2> and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research.

[CLS] “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of <e1>NSO</e1>’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.” The spyware has been abused in this way in the past – in 2017, it was discovered that dozens of Mexican journalists and lawyers (and even a child) had their devices infected by Pegasus in a campaign believed to be carried out by the nation’s government. <e2>Marczak</e2>, for his part, told us that the spyware’s civil rights abuse is a sign of what’s to come: “Civil society will increasingly find itself the target of this type of sophisticated surveillance unless the governments better regulate the spyware industry,” he said.

[CLS] What is sure is that the gap in the Android banking malware rental business left open after the rental of the Anubis 2 and <e1>RedAlert 2</e1> Trojans ended provides a good opportunity for the actors behind Cerberus to grow their business quickly. The Android banking Trojan rental business Rental of banking Trojans is not new. It was an existing business model when computer-based banking malware was the only form of banking malware and has shifted to the Android equivalent a few years later. The life span of Android banking malware is limited to either the will of its author(s) to support it or the arrest of those actors. This malware-life-cycle has been observed to reoccur every few years, bringing new malware families into light. Each time a rented malware reaches the end of its life it provides the opportunity for other actors a to take over the malware rental market-share. As visible on following chart, the lifespan of many well-known rented Android bankers is usually no more than one or two years. When the family ceases to exist a new one is already available to fill the void, proving that the demand for such malware is always present and that therefore Cerberus has a good chance to survive. After the actor behind RedAlert 2 decided to quit the rental business, we observed a surge in Anubis samples in the wild. After the Anubis actor was allegedly arrested and the source code was leaked there was also huge increase in the number of Anubis samples found in the wild, but the new actors using Anubis have no support or updates. Due to this Cerberus will come in handy for actors that want to focus on performing fraud without having to develop and maintain a <e2>botnet</e2> and C2 infrastructure. [SEP]
[CLS] This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told <e1>Threatpost</e1>. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an <e2>Amnesty International</e2> staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018.

[CLS] As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. <e1>Evil Eye</e1> leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass Apple's iOS security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia. In addition to watering hole attacks, the group used fake Facebook accounts to build trust with targets before prompting them to click on malicious links, Facebook said. "On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself," Mike Dvilyanski, head of Facebook's cyber espionage investigations, and <e2>Nathaniel Gleicher,</e2> head of the company's security policy, said the post.

[CLS] Cybercriminals typically use third-party app marketplaces to distribute their malicious apps, but in operations such as the ones that distributed CPUMINER, <e1>BankBot</e1>, and MilkyDoor, they would try to get their apps published on Google Play or App Store. We’ve also seen others take a more subtle approach that involves SmiShing to direct potential victims to malicious pages. Case in point: a campaign we recently observed that uses SMS as an entry point to deliver an information stealer we called FakeSpy (Trend Micro detects this threat ANDROIDOS_FAKESPY.HRX). FakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and call records stored in the infected device.

[CLS] “Often the app description on the <e2>Play Store</e2> would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page,” researchers said. “All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian.” Security Without Borders told Threatpost that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to Google Play – and while Google did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand. Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. <e1>eSurv</e1> Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv.

All known targets have been alerted. While the iOS version removed itself if it detected a jailbreak, the Android tool would delete if it couldn't contact command and control servers for a set period of time. Or if certain tools, revealed by "antidote files," that could detect the malware were spied by Pegasus, it would disappear. One of the samples, aimed at Samsung phones, removed the manufacturer's system update app to prevent security fixes from disrupting its snooping. Flossman believes that Pegasus for Android was delivered in a similar fashion to its iPhone equivalent, via an SMS message. "The various exploits contained in this surveillance-ware would attempt to be run once the app was installed," Flossman said. "If these exploits were patched on the target device, Pegasus would still be able to function but with a reduced set of capabilities." Google said Pegasus never found its way onto the official Play store. But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called Framaroot, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system. Other Android samples may use zero-days, Lookout warned. Google found most targets were located in Israel, though individuals in numerous countries were targeted, including Georgia, Mexico, Turkey and the UAE. <e2>NSO Group</e2> hadn't responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

[CLS] Meet Monokle, an Android Malware Family Capable of Stealing and Changing Passwords Special Technology Center (STC) is a software development company based in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the <e1>American Government</e1> hasn't been particularly happy with it. In 2016, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on STC because his administration believed that it was one of the three companies that helped the Russian government interfere with the USA's 2016 presidential elections. It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for STC, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called Monokle. Monokle and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible. Lookout's experts think, however, that there is plenty of evidence linking Monokle to STC. According to Lookout's technical report, STC is in the business of developing, among other things, a suite of defensive products for Android devices which is allegedly sold exclusively to <e2>Russian government agencies</e2>. The company also has a control panel application called App Control through which the rest of STC's services are managed. [SEP]
[CLS] The spyware appears to have been developed by an <e1>Italian firm</e1>, which is now under investigation for its development. Researchers allege that the apps have infected several hundred – up to even as many as a thousand – Italian victims with the malware, dubbed Exodus. Researchers with nonprofit security firm Security Without Borders said that they uncovered the spyware, dubbed Exodus, being passed through at least 25 malicious apps on Google Play. The apps have since been removed. “Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators,” said researchers in a Friday analysis. “Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350.” Researchers said they collected samples of Exodus from 2016 to early 2019. They found that it has a variety of nefarious capabilities, including scooping up call logs and SMS messages, Facebook, Gmail and WhatsApp data and conversations, audio-recording the victim and extracting GPS coordinates of the phone. It can also retrieve a list of installed apps, retrieve the device’s browsing history, extract events from the <e2>Calendar app</e2> and access the owner’s address book. [SEP]

[CLS] Dangerous <e1>Pegasus</e1> Spyware Has Spread to 45 Countries The malicious spyware has also been found in use in countries known for targeting human rights. The infamous Pegasus spyware, which targets iPhones and Android devices, has allegedly infiltrated 45 different countries across the globe — and six of those countries have used surveillance malware in the past to abuse human rights, a group of researchers claimed Tuesday. Researchers from The Citizen Lab scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company NSO Group as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” <e2>Bill Marczak</e2>, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost.

[CLS] DEFENSOR ID - A new threat <e2>ESET</e2> researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, <e1>Cybereason</e1> analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named Eventbot, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.

The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time. XLoader abuses the MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission. Mitigations XLoader will not download malicious apps if the Android device uses a mobile data connection. Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router’s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router’s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall. For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats. Everyday users can do the same by checking the router’s DNS settings if they’ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware. We have worked with Google and they ensure that Google Play Protect proactively catches apps of this nature. No instances of these apps were found in Google Play.

Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software.

[CLS] Google Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile spyware created by NSO Group, an <e2>Israeli</e2> surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. Pegasus for iPhone was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers. The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout.

The most widespread campaign last seen using Anubis was in February, a new phishing campaign targeting more than 250 Android apps was aimed at using the trojan to steal user credentials, install a keylogger, and even hold a device’s data for ransom. Meanwhile, Google historically has struggled mightily to keep malware off Android devices and apps on the Google Play Store. Anubis is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting financial and banking apps available for the platform.

[CLS] Click fraud apps The authors' tactics evolved from advertisement spam to real PHA (Click Fraud). <e2>Click fraud PHA</e2>s simulate user clicks on ads instead of simply displaying ads and waiting for users to click them. This allows the PHA authors to monetize their apps more effectively than through regular advertising. This behavior negatively impacts advertisement networks and their clients because advertising budget is spent without acquiring real customers, and impacts user experience by consuming their data plan resources. The click fraud PHA requests a URL to the advertising network directly instead of proxying it through an additional SDK. The command & control server (C&C server) returns the URL to click along with a very long list of additional parameters in JSON format. After rendering the ad on the screen, the app tries to identify the part of the advertisement website to click. If that part is found, the app loads Javascript snippets from the JSON parameters to click a button or other HTML element, simulating a real user click. Because a user interacting with an ad often leads to a higher chance of the user purchasing something, ad networks often "pay per click" to developers who host their ads. Therefore, by simulating fraudulent clicks, these developers are making money without requiring a user to click on an advertisement. Based on this JSON reply, the app looks for an HTML snippet that corresponds to the active element (show_hide btnnext) and, if found, the Javascript snippet tries to perform a click() method on it.

"On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself," Mike Dvilyanski, head of Facebook's cyber espionage investigations, and Nathaniel Gleicher, head of the company's security policy, said the post. "We saw this activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies' actions to disrupt their activity." As detailed in a report from security firm Volexity last year, Insomnia worked on any web browser running in all versions of iOS 10 and 11, as well as iOS 12.0, 12.1, 12.3, 12.3.1 and iOS 12.3.2. Once installed, the malware granted access to a user's Contacts, location, Messages data, and information from third-party apps. Apple patched the offending <e2>WebKit flaw</e2> in iOS 12. [SEP]

Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too. Red Alert 2.0 is also advertised as able to intercept and send SMS messages and launch APKs. The author also claims new functionality is being developed, that injects can be built per customer request, and that updates are being released every two weeks. Miscreants can rent the Trojan starting at $200 for 7 days, $500 for a month, or $999 for 2 months. As part of the analyzed Red Alert 2.0 attack, the malware was being distributed attached to spam messages.

[CLS] Android Accessibility Services Vulnerable to Android Malware <e1>Defensor ID</e1> Android Accessibility Services has been caught with unexpected consequences as hackers are creating sneaky malware to use this service for malicious intents and to interact with the system’s interface and applications. A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as <e2>GAS Brazil</e2>. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. [SEP]
[CLS] Backdoor Commands The <e1>Red Alert</e1> code also contains an embedded list of commands the botmaster can send to the bot. The malware can execute a variety of arbitrary commands, including (for example) intercepting or sending text messages without the user’s knowledge, obtaining a copy of the victim’s Address Book, or call or text message logs, or sending phone network feature codes (also known as USSD codes). C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app’s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we’ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we’ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we’ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on port 7878/tcp. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a Twitter account. Static analysis of the code reveals that the malware downloads the overlay template to use against any of the bank(s) it is targeting. The malware also sends regular telemetry back to its C2 server about the infected device in the form of an HTTP POST to its C2 server. It uses the base Dalvik User-Agent string for the device it’s running on. The list of banks targeted by Red Alert 2.0 includes NatWest, <e2>Barclays</e2>, Westpac, and Citibank. [SEP]

[CLS] We construe AnubisSpy to be linked to the cyberespionage campaign <e1>Sphinx (APT-C-15)</e1> based on shared file structures and command-and-control (C&C) server as well as targets. It’s also possible that while AnubisSpy’s operators may also be Sphinx’s, they could be running separate but similar campaigns. What can AnubisSpy do? AnubisSpy can steal messages (SMS), photos, videos, contacts, email accounts, calendar events, and browser histories (i.e., Chrome and Samsung Internet Browser). It can also take screenshots and record audio, including calls. It can spy on the victim through apps installed on the device, a list of which is in its configuration file that can be updated. This includes Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, among others. After the data are collected, they are encrypted and sent to the (C&C) server. AnubisSpy can also self-destruct to cover its tracks. It can run commands and delete files on the device, as well as install and uninstall Android Application Packages (APKs). AnubisSpy has several modules, each of which has a separate role. AnubisSpy’s code is well constructed, indicating the developer/s’ know-how. Below is a visualization of the modules: How is AnubisSpy related to Sphinx? Sphinx reportedly uses the watering hole technique via social media sites to deliver its payloads — mainly a customized version of njRAT. The Sphinx campaign operators cloaked the malware with icons of legitimate applications to dupe recipients into clicking them. Sphinx was active between June 2014 and <e2>November 2015</e2>, but timestamps of the malware indicate the attacks started as early as 2011. [SEP]

At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, <e2>Rwanda</e2>, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, <e2>Check Point</e2> Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction.

When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs’ researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan’s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.

[CLS] ” Exodus The malware was spread via mobile applications on Google Play purporting to be service apps distributed by unspecified mobile operators in <e2>Italy</e2>. “Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page,” researchers said. “All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian.” Security Without Borders told Threatpost that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to Google Play – and while Google did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand. Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. <e1>eSurv</e1> Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv.

[CLS] Potent <e2>Skygofree</e2> Malware Packs ‘Never-Before-Seen’ Features Researchers have identified a powerful new Android malware strain called Skygofree capable of eavesdropping on WhatsApp messages, siphoning private data off phones and allowing adversaries to open reverse shell modules on targeted devices, giving attackers ultimate remote control. Researchers said the malware was developed three years ago and has evolved significantly since then to include 48 unique commands in it most recent iteration. Several of those features have never been seen before in Android malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the Skygofree strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research.

[CLS] The threat actors behind Anubis also are developing a way to integrate <e2>Yandex maps</e2> into the malware to show the location of infected devices, according to the report. However, this could be a superfluous addition, as the mobile network to which a device is attached is usually can tell a hacker where the phone is located, Holden noted in the report. Anubis malware has been active since late 2017. The sophisticated malware originally was used for cyber-espionage and later repurposed as a banking trojan. The most widespread campaign last seen using Anubis was in February, a new phishing campaign targeting more than 250 Android apps was aimed at using the trojan to steal user credentials, install a keylogger, and even hold a device’s data for ransom. Meanwhile, Google historically has struggled mightily to keep malware off Android devices and apps on the Google Play Store. Anubis is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting financial and banking apps available for the platform. Last year, researchers discovered two malicious apps, <e1>Currency Converter</e1> and BatterySaverMobo, that were infecting devices with Anubis to steal user credentials. [SEP]

[CLS] Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include <e2>China</e2>, France, Germany, the UK, and the United States. The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn’t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user’s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user’s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information. As to where the malware originated from, researchers claim that all signs point to a Chinese group known as “Roaming Mantis.” <e1>Cybereason</e1> concludes: The malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped. [SEP]
[CLS] Speaking at <e1>Kaspersky NEXT 2020</e1> on Wednesday, Kaspersky cybersecurity researcher Dmitry Galov said that the leaked code, distributed under the name Cerberus v2, presents an increased threat for smartphone users and the banking sector at large. Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections. OTPs generated through Google Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, <e2>Hudson Rock</e2> spotted Cerberus going to auction. [SEP]
[CLS] Several of those features have never been seen before in <e2>Android</e2> malware, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab who discovered the Skygofree strain last year and disclosed its findings Tuesday. “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research. Clues as to who is behind the malware trace back to the Italian firm Negg International. Researchers said domains used for landing pages to spread the malware were registered to the company. Negg International did not return requests for comment. According to the company’s website, it offers a wide range of app development, pen testing and cybersecurity consulting services. Kaspersky Lab said Skygofree victims were likely infected via malicious redirects or man-in-the-middle attacks driving users to landing pages that mimic mobile carrier web sites. Those landing pages included similar domain names and web page content to wireless carriers. Once targets were lured to landing page sites they were prompted to update their phone’s software. “Dear Customer, in order to avoid malfunctions to your internet connection, we encourage you to upgrade your configuration. Download the update now and keep on navigating at maximum speed,” read one fake landing page targeting Vodafone customers. Researchers describe Skygofree as a complex system capable of a wide range of spying, similar to <e1>Pegasus</e1> discovered in August 2016. [SEP]
[CLS] They also state that the code is written from scratch and is not using parts of other existing banking Trojans unlike many other Trojans that are either based completely on the source of another Trojan (such as the leaked <e1>Anubis</e1> source code that is now being resold) or at least borrow parts of other Trojans. After thorough analysis we can confirm that Cerberus was indeed not based on the Anubis source code. One peculiar thing about the actor group behind this banking malware is that they have an “official” twitter account that they use to post promotional content (even videos) about the malware. Oddly enough they also use it to make fun of the AV community, sharing detection screenshots from VirusTotal (thus leaking IoC) and even engaging in discussions with malware researchers directly. The following screenshot shows tweets from their advertisement campaign: That unusual behavior could be explained by the combination of the need for attention and a probable lack of experience. What is sure is that the gap in the Android banking malware rental business left open after the rental of the Anubis 2 and <e2>RedAlert 2</e2> Trojans ended provides a good opportunity for the actors behind Cerberus to grow their business quickly.

[CLS] How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the <e2>Accessibility Services</e2> leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named Eventbot, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication. In March 2020, McAfee Mobile Research team observed an Android malware dubbed <e1>Android/LeifAccess.A</e1> that abused OAuth leveraging accessibility services to infect Android devices and post fake reviews on Google Play.

Speaking at Kaspersky NEXT 2020 on Wednesday, Kaspersky cybersecurity researcher Dmitry Galov said that the leaked code, distributed under the name Cerberus v2, presents an increased threat for smartphone users and the banking sector at large. Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system.

[CLS] Monokle is aimed at specific targets The earliest sample <e1>Lookout</e1> examined dates back to 2015, but Monokle is still being used in attacks to this day. As with most Android malware families, the primary infection vector comes in the form of trojanized apps distributed on third-party app stores. Most of them impersonate real applications, and some even come with legitimate functionality, which can make detection more difficult. Based on the titles and the icons of the malicious apps, the experts concluded that Monokle is used in highly targeted attacks against specific sets of users. Some of the applications were clearly designed to catch the attention of people associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria. Others were aimed at users situated in the former Soviet republic of <e2>Uzbekistan</e2>, and a third group targeted people situated in the Caucasus region of Eastern Europe. [SEP]

[CLS] SMS_DELIVERED Creating a Web Server to Phish <e1>XLoader</e1> creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events. It can also create a simple HTTP server on the infected device to deceive victims. It shows a web phishing page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event (i.e., if a new package is installed or if the device’s screen is on) to steal personal data, such as those keyed in for banking apps. The phishing page is translated in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English, which are hardcoded in the payload. It will appear differently to users depending on the language set on the device. XLoader as Spyware and Banking Trojan XLoader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device. Its data-stealing capabilities include collecting SMSs after receiving an SMS-related broadcast event and covertly recording phone calls. XLoader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or game-related apps installed on the affected device. XLoader can also start other attacker-specified packages. A possible attack scenario involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions. By monitoring the package installation broadcast event, XLoader can start their packages. This enables it to launch malicious apps without the user’s awareness and explicit consent. We reverse engineered XLoader and found that it appears to target South Korea-based banks and game development companies. XLoader also prevents victims from accessing the device’s settings or using a known <e2>antivirus</e2> (AV) app in the country. [SEP]
[CLS] ” Security Without Borders told Threatpost that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to Google Play – and while <e2>Google</e2> did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand. Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an <e1>Italian company</e1> called eSurv.

[CLS] A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the <e2>Sciendo</e2> report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords.

[CLS] SophosLabs has uncovered a mobile malware distribution campaign that uses advertising placement to distribute the <e2>Red Alert</e2> Trojan, linking counterfeit branding of well-known apps to Web pages that deliver an updated, 2.0 version of this bank credential thief. The group distributing this family of malware decorates it in the branding and logos of well-known social media or media player apps, system update patches, or (in its most recent campaign) VPN client apps in an attempt to lure users into downloading, installing, and elevating the privileges of a Trojanized app hosted on a site not affiliated with any reputable app market or store. Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software. The Web page shown here on the left is hosted on a domain that seems apt: <e1>free-vpn[.]download.</e1> Investigation of this domain led to additional domains that appear to have been registered for use with the campaign, but are not in use yet.

[CLS] Below is a visualization of the modules: How is AnubisSpy related to Sphinx? <e1>Sphinx</e1> reportedly uses the watering hole technique via social media sites to deliver its payloads — mainly a customized version of njRAT. The Sphinx campaign operators cloaked the malware with icons of legitimate applications to dupe recipients into clicking them. Sphinx was active between June 2014 and November 2015, but timestamps of the malware indicate the attacks started as early as 2011. A simple WHOIS query of AnubisSpy’s C&C server showed it abused a legitimate managed hosting service provider in Belize. We correlated the AnubisSpy variants to Sphinx’s desktop/PC-targeting malware through the following: Shared C&C server, 86[.]105[.]18[.]107 Shared technique of decrypting JSON files, and similarity between the file structures of AnubisSpy and Sphinx’s malware Similar targets (highly concentrated in Middle Eastern countries) These apps were all written in Arabic and, in one way or another, related to something in Egypt (i.e., spoofing an Egypt-based TV program and using news/stories in the Middle East) regardless of the labels and objects in the apps. Our coordination with Google also revealed that these apps were installed across a handful of countries in the Middle East. Was AnubisSpy actively distributed? We analyzed seven apps that were actually AnubisSpy. These were signed with the same fake Google certificates. We found two more apps created by the same developer, but they had no espionage-related codes; we think they were made as experimental projects. Based on hardcoded strings in the Agent Version, the malicious apps were developed as early as April 2015. Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on <e2>June 2015</e2>; the latest variant was signed on May 2017. [SEP]

[CLS] HummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. <e1>HummingBad</e1> attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars.

[CLS] With this blog series we will be sharing our research analysis with the research and broader security community, starting with the PHA family, Zen. <e1>Zen</e1> uses root permissions on a device to automatically enable a service that creates fake Google accounts. These accounts are created by abusing accessibility services. Zen apps gain access to root permissions from a rooting trojan in its infection chain. In this blog post, we do not differentiate between the rooting component and the component that abuses root: we refer to them interchangeably as Zen. We also describe apps that we think are coming from the same author or a group of authors. All of the PHAs that are mentioned in this blog post were detected and removed by Google Play Protect. Background Uncovering PHAs takes a lot of detective work and unraveling the mystery of how they're possibly connected to other apps takes even more. PHA authors usually try to hide their tracks, so attribution is difficult. Sometimes, we can attribute different apps to the same author based on a small, unique pieces of evidence that suggest similarity, such as a repetition of an exceptionally rare code snippet, asset, or a particular string in the debug logs. Every once in a while, authors leave behind a trace that allows us to attribute not only similar apps, but also multiple different PHA families to the same group or person. However, the actual timeline of the creation of different variants is unclear. In April 2013, we saw the first sample, which made heavy use of dynamic code loading (i.e., fetching executable code from remote sources after the initial app is installed). Dynamic code loading makes it impossible to state what kind of PHA it was. This sample displayed ads from various sources. More recent variants blend rooting capabilities and click fraud. As rooting exploits on Android become less prevalent and lucrative, PHA authors adapt their abuse or monetization strategy to focus on tactics like <e2>click fraud</e2>. This post doesn't follow the chronological evolution of Zen, but instead covers relevant samples from least to most complex. [SEP]
[CLS] After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as <e1>Chrysaor</e1> — that’s what Google calls it. The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that’s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. Pegasus for Android was also spotted in Turkey, <e2>Kenya</e2>, Nigeria, UAE, and other countries. [SEP]
[CLS] The "suicide" self-destruct feature was particularly devilish, helping <e1>NSO Group</e1>'s malware avoid detection for almost three years. "If it feels like it's going to be found, it removes itself," said Lookout mobile security researcher Michael Flossman. "That's why it took so long to find these samples." Lookout and Google said that though the samples date from 2014, there was evidence the spyware was working on some victim Android phones when discovered in the last few months. All known targets have been alerted. While the iOS version removed itself if it detected a jailbreak, the Android tool would delete if it couldn't contact command and control servers for a set period of time. Or if certain tools, revealed by "antidote files," that could detect the malware were spied by Pegasus, it would disappear. One of the samples, aimed at Samsung phones, removed the manufacturer's system update app to prevent security fixes from disrupting its snooping. <e2>Flossman</e2> believes that Pegasus for Android was delivered in a similar fashion to its iPhone equivalent, via an SMS message.

[CLS] Pegasus was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the <e1>NSO Group</e1>. Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident. Kaspersky Lab said in the case of Skygofree, it was only aware of a handful of users in Italy being targeted with the malware. Those Italian links have also prompted comparison between Skygofree and Italy-based intrusion software vendor HackingTeam. HackingTeam is known for selling surveillance and intrusion software products designed to help law enforcement agencies and other customers perform remote penetration and control of target systems. “Given the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code, as well as infrastructure analysis, we are pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like HackingTeam,” researchers wrote.

[CLS] Researchers at Check Point said they found the malware, dubbed Judy, on about 50 apps in <e1>Google</e1>'s Play Store. The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators. The infected apps have been removed from the Play Store. More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, Kiniwini, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name Enistudio. The games, all of which feature a character called Judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times. 'Hid undetected' The malicious code was also found in several apps from other developers. "It is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly," said Check Point. Between them, the infected apps may have been downloaded up to 36.5 million times. Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the Judy games had been updated since March this year. The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that "the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected". Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. Ad clicks The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code. Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts. This kind of delivery "has become commonplace", Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in Networking at the Open University, told the <e2>BBC</e2>.

[CLS] Android Accessibility Services Vulnerable to Android Malware <e1>Defensor ID</e1> Android Accessibility Services has been caught with unexpected consequences as hackers are creating sneaky malware to use this service for malicious intents and to interact with the system’s interface and applications. A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the <e2>Accessibility Services</e2> leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords.

It’s also possible that while AnubisSpy’s operators may also be Sphinx’s, they could be running separate but similar campaigns. What can AnubisSpy do? AnubisSpy can steal messages (SMS), photos, videos, contacts, email accounts, calendar events, and browser histories (i.e., Chrome and Samsung Internet Browser). It can also take screenshots and record audio, including calls. It can spy on the victim through apps installed on the device, a list of which is in its configuration file that can be updated.

[CLS] <e1>Virulent</e1> Android malware returns, gets >2 million downloads on Google Play A virulent family of malware that infected more than 10 million Android devices last year has made a comeback, this time hiding inside Google Play apps that have been downloaded by as many as 12 million unsuspecting users. HummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. HummingBad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official <e2>app stores</e2> as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars.

[CLS] But, in the meantime, the best form of defence that users can adopt involves aspects of security hygiene that they should be practicing already across their mobile devices and banking security,” comments Dmitry Galov, Security Researcher at <e1>Kaspersky</e1>. Kaspersky’s security advice for mobile banking users Only download and install applications from official app stores such as Google Play on Android devices, or in the App Store on iOS. Deactivate the function for installing programs from unknown sources in the settings of the smartphone. Never “root” devices as this gives cybercriminals unlimited possibilities to carry out attacks. Install system and application updates promptly to fix security gaps. Updates to the mobile operating system should never be downloaded from external resources. When it comes to financial or personal details, always adopt a default strategy of attentiveness and scepticism, so as to remain vigilant. Use a reliable security solution such as Kaspersky Security Cloud to protect against a wide range of threats. To learn more about Cerberus, please visit our <e2>Securelist</e2> web page. [SEP]

[CLS] <e2>Google</e2> Just Found (Probably) The Most Dangerous Android Malware Ever Seen Google has uncovered the Android version of Pegasus, a mobile spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company considered the most advanced producer of mobile spyware on the planet. Pegasus for iPhone was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers. The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout.

[CLS] The <e1>Anubis</e1> malware, which threat actors use to persistently attack Google’s Android-based smartphones, is set to evolve once again, this time adding a feature that allows the malware to identify if a victim is looking at his or her screen. The new feature is one of several that haven’t been released in the wild yet but are a part of an updated control panel for the malware that’s currently in development, researchers from security consulting firm Hold Security discovered, according to a report published online. The panel is a web-based module that explores devices that have already been infiltrated by Anubis, researchers said. Threat actors use it to view and decide from which device they want to steal data as well as which services on devices to target. The new control panel will add features that provide even more insight so attackers can fully take advantage of a device, Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security, told Bank Info Security. One key addition to the malware is a small eyeball icon included in the control panel that can be used to recognize whether a user of a device with Anubis installed is looking at the device or not. The idea is that an attacker won’t perform any nefarious activity on the device while the person is looking at it, he said. The threat actors behind Anubis also are developing a way to integrate Yandex maps into the malware to show the location of infected devices, according to the report. However, this could be a superfluous addition, as the mobile network to which a device is attached is usually can tell a hacker where the phone is located, Holden noted in the report. Anubis malware has been active since late 2017. The sophisticated malware originally was used for cyber-espionage and later repurposed as a banking trojan. The most widespread campaign last seen using Anubis was in February, a new phishing campaign targeting more than 250 Android apps was aimed at using the <e2>trojan</e2> to steal user credentials, install a keylogger, and even hold a device’s data for ransom.

[CLS] Backdoor Commands The <e1>Red Alert</e1> code also contains an embedded list of commands the botmaster can send to the bot. The malware can execute a variety of arbitrary commands, including (for example) intercepting or sending text messages without the user’s knowledge, obtaining a copy of the victim’s Address Book, or call or text message logs, or sending phone network feature codes (also known as USSD codes). C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app’s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we’ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we’ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we’ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on port 7878/tcp. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a Twitter account. Static analysis of the code reveals that the malware downloads the overlay template to use against any of the bank(s) it is targeting. The malware also sends regular telemetry back to its C2 server about the infected device in the form of an HTTP POST to its C2 server. It uses the base Dalvik User-Agent string for the device it’s running on. The list of banks targeted by Red Alert 2.0 includes NatWest, Barclays, <e2>Westpac</e2>, and Citibank. [SEP]

[CLS] 0: Android Trojan targets security-seekers A malicious, counterfeit version of a VPN client for mobile devices targets security-minded victims with a <e2>RAT</e2>. SophosLabs has uncovered a mobile malware distribution campaign that uses advertising placement to distribute the Red Alert Trojan, linking counterfeit branding of well-known apps to Web pages that deliver an updated, 2.0 version of this bank credential thief. The group distributing this family of malware decorates it in the branding and logos of well-known social media or media player apps, system update patches, or (in its most recent campaign) VPN client apps in an attempt to lure users into downloading, installing, and elevating the privileges of a Trojanized app hosted on a site not affiliated with any reputable app market or store. Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN’s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software. The Web page shown here on the left is hosted on a domain that seems apt: free-vpn[.]download. Investigation of this domain led to additional domains that appear to have been registered for use with the campaign, but are not in use yet.

[CLS] Pegasus was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the <e1>NSO Group</e1>. Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident. Kaspersky Lab said in the case of Skygofree, it was only aware of a handful of users in Italy being targeted with the malware. Those Italian links have also prompted comparison between Skygofree and Italy-based intrusion software vendor HackingTeam. HackingTeam is known for selling surveillance and intrusion software products designed to help law enforcement agencies and other customers perform remote penetration and control of target systems. “Given the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code, as well as infrastructure analysis, we are pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like HackingTeam,” researchers wrote. Kaspersky Lab researchers said Skygofree’s advanced spy features also included recording Skype conversations and the unique ability to capture WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted conversations via exploiting Android Accessibility Services designed to assist users with disabilities. “The payload uses the Android Accessibility Service to get information directly from the displayed elements on the screen, so it waits for the targeted application to be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages,” researchers wrote regarding capturing <e2>WhatsApp</e2> conversations.

[CLS] After the actor behind RedAlert 2 decided to quit the rental business, we observed a surge in <e1>Anubis</e1> samples in the wild. After the Anubis actor was allegedly arrested and the source code was leaked there was also huge increase in the number of Anubis samples found in the wild, but the new actors using Anubis have no support or updates. Due to this Cerberus will come in handy for actors that want to focus on performing fraud without having to develop and maintain a botnet and C2 infrastructure. Analysis of evasion techniques Along with the standard payload and string obfuscation, Cerberus uses a rather interesting technique to prevent analysis of the Trojan. Using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim. The idea is simple - if the infected device belongs to a real person, sooner or later this person will move around, increasing the step counter. The Trojan uses this counter to activate the bot - if aforementioned step counter hits the pre-configured threshold it considers running on the device to be safe. This simple measure prevents the Trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments (sandboxes) and on the test devices of malware analysts. The code responsible for this verification is shown in the following snippet: How it works When the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer. Then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot: After the user grants the requested privilege, Cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions, such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls, without requiring any user interaction. It also disables Play Protect (Google’s preinstalled <e2>antivirus</e2> solution) to prevent its discovery and deletion in the future. [SEP]
[CLS] Android Accessibility Services Vulnerable to Android Malware <e1>Defensor ID</e1> Android Accessibility Services has been caught with unexpected consequences as hackers are creating sneaky malware to use this service for malicious intents and to interact with the system’s interface and applications. A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. <e2>DEFENSOR ID</e2> - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts.

[CLS] The new variants have "incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains," Sophos threat researcher <e2>Pankaj Kohli</e2> said in a report published Tuesday. Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, <e1>GnatSpy</e1>, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

[CLS] Ginp - A malware patchwork borrowing from <e1>Anubis</e1> Intro ThreatFabric analysts have recently investigated an interesting new strain of banking malware. The malware was first spotted by Tatyana Shishkova from Kaspersky by end October 2019, but actually dates back to June 2019. It is still under active development, with at least 5 different versions of the Trojan released within the last 5 months (June - November 2019). What makes Ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware. In addition, its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on Spanish banks. Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then their credit card details. Although multi-step overlays are not something new, their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion. Evolution The initial version of the malware dates back to early June 2019, masquerading as a “Google Play Verificator” app. At that time, Ginp was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “<e2>Adobe Flash Player</e2>” apps. [SEP]
[CLS] Pegasus has been attributed to the <e1>NSO</e1> Group, an Israeli company whose bread and butter is developing spyware. That means the malware is commercial — it’s sold to whoever is willing to pay for it. Pegasus relied on a whopping three zero-day (previously unknown) vulnerabilities in iOS that allowed it to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software. Another cybersecurity firm, Zerodium, once offered $1 million for an iOS zero-day, so you can imagine that it cost quite a bit of money to create Pegasus. As for surveillance, let’s be clear: We’re talking total surveillance. Pegasus is modular malware. After scanning the target’s device, it installs the necessary modules to read the user’s messages and mail, listen to calls, capture screenshots, log pressed keys, exfiltrate browser history, contacts, and so on and so forth. Basically, it can spy on every aspect of the target’s life. It’s also noteworthy that Pegasus could even listen to encrypted audio streams and read encrypted messages — thanks to its keylogging and audio recording capabilities, it was stealing messages before they were encrypted (and, for incoming messages, after decryption). Another interesting fact about Pegasus is that it tries to hide itself really diligently. The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; NSO’s clients weren’t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as <e2>Chrysaor</e2> — that’s what Google calls it. [SEP]
[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, <e2>Lebanon</e2>, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

[CLS] A new malware called Defensor ID was recently found targeting this service in Android devices. <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users.

[CLS] Researchers from The Citizen Lab scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company <e1>NSO Group</e1> as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, <e2>Mexico</e2>, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

[CLS] ” Security Without Borders told <e1>Threatpost</e1> that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to Google Play – and while Google did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand. Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. “Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,” said researchers. “Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.” Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app). Interestingly, almost immediately thereafter, the spyware quickly upgrades to the second stage – suggesting that the C2 operators are not enforcing a validation of the targets, researchers said. “During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins,” researchers said. “Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators.” The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities. eSurv Researchers pinned the malware developer back to an Italian company called eSurv. eSurv, based in Catanzaro, in <e2>Calabria</e2>, Italy, publicly advertises products like CCTV management systems, surveillance drones, face and license-plate recognition systems.

[CLS] <e1>Skygofree</e1> Android malware is ‘one of the most powerful ever seen’ The dangerous new spyware kit can gain total control over an Android device, and it's been in the wild since 2015. A newly discovered form of Android malware, called Skygofree, can record device audio, video, and photos, steal data from device memory, read geolocation data, and even steal WhatsApp messages. Skygofree is dangerous, but it’s spreading using the same old methods: compromised websites. Stay protected using good antivirus software and knowing what to watch out for. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab have uncovered a form of Android malware they’re saying is one of the most powerful ever seen in the wild. Dubbed Skygofree, the total spyware package is capable of performing 48 different remote commands, including capturing photos and video, recording audio, automatically connecting to compromised Wi-Fi networks, reading WhatsApp messages, stealing data from the device’s memory, reading geolocation data, and more. Skygofree is even capable of activating geofences that trigger audio recording once the infected device enters a certain area. Kaspersky Lab says the malware appeared in the wild in 2015, and the campaign to spread it is still active–new spoof domains containing its dropper have been registered as recently as <e2>late October 2017</e2>. To make matters worse, Kaspersky Lab says Skygofree has all the hallmarks of a professionally developed spy kit meant to be sold for use to surveill users, like the code stolen from Hacking Team in 2015.

[CLS] Cerberus banking Trojan source code released for free to cyberattackers An auction designed to net the developer of the <e2>Android</e2> malware $100,000 failed. The source code of the Cerberus banking Trojan has been released as free malware on underground hacking forums following a failed auction. Speaking at Kaspersky NEXT 2020 on Wednesday, Kaspersky cybersecurity researcher Dmitry Galov said that the leaked code, distributed under the name Cerberus v2, presents an increased threat for smartphone users and the banking sector at large. Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections. OTPs generated through Google Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. "Despite Cerberus' <e1>Russian speaking developers</e1> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team," Kaspersky says.

[CLS] Details: Name : Super Mario Run Package Name : <e1>net.droidjack.server</e1> MD5 : 69b4b32e4636f1981841cbbe3b927560 Technical Analysis: The malicious package claims to be the Super Mario Run game, as shown in the permissions screenshot below, but in reality this is a malicious RAT called DroidJack (also known as SandroRAT) that is getting installed. DroidJack RAT starts capturing sensitive information like call data, SMS data, videos, photos, etc. Observe below the code routine for call recording. This RAT records all the calls and stores the recording to an “.amr” file. The following is the code routine for video capturing. Here, the RAT stores all the captured videos in a “video.3gp” file. It also harvests call details and SMS logs as shown below. Upon further inspection, we have observed that this RAT extracts WhatsApp data too. The RAT stores all the data in a database (DB) in order to send it to the Command & Control (C&C) server. The following are the DBs created and maintained by the RAT. We saw the following hardcoded C&C server location in the RAT package: Conclusion: The DroidJack RAT is another example of a growing trend in which malware authors seek to exploit public interest as a way to spread malware. In this case, like others before, the event of a popular game release became an opportunity to trick unsuspecting users into downloading the RAT. As a reminder, it is always a good practice to download apps only from trusted app stores such as <e2>Google Play</e2>. This practice can be enforced by unchecking the "Unknown Sources" option under the "Security" settings of your device. [SEP]

[CLS] Pegasus: The ultimate spyware for iOS and Android <e2>Apple</e2> iPhone and iPad users usually believe they are safe. There’s no malware for iOS, they say. Apple does little to discourage the impression — the “fruit company” doesn’t even allow antivirus solutions in its App Store, because, you know, allegedly they’re not needed. The keyword here is allegedly. There actually is malware in the wild that targets iOS users — it’s been proved a number of times, and in August 2016 researchers proved it again by revealing the existence of Pegasus, spyware capable of hacking any iPad or iPhone, harvesting data about the victim, and establishing surveillance on them. That discovery made the whole cybersecurity world… uneasy. At our Security Analyst Summit, researchers from Lookout revealed that Pegasus exists not only for iOS, but for Android as well. The Android version is different in some ways from its iOS predecessor. Let’s shed some light on Pegasus and explain why we use the word “ultimate” to describe it. Pegasus: The beginning Pegasus was discovered thanks to Ahmed Mansoor, a UAE human rights activist, who happened to be one of its targets. It was a spear-phishing attack: He received several SMS messages that contained what he thought were malicious links, so he sent those messages to security experts from Citizen Lab, and they brought another cybersecurity firm, Lookout, to the investigation. Mansoor was right. If he had clicked, his iPhone would have been infected with malware — malware for iOS. For non-jailbroken iOS, to be precise. The malware was dubbed Pegasus, and Lookout researchers called it the most sophisticated attack they’d ever seen on any endpoint. Pegasus has been attributed to the <e1>NSO</e1> Group, an Israeli company whose bread and butter is developing spyware. [SEP]
[CLS] Announced in a blog post, Facebook's action targeted a group of hackers known in the security community as <e1>Earth Empusa</e1> or Evil Eye. The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the Chinese government, deployed iOS and Android malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents. Uyghurs from Xinjiang who moved abroad were the main target of the group's activities. As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019. Evil Eye leveraged multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to bypass Apple's iOS security layer and secretly infect user devices with a malware dubbed Insomnia. In addition to watering hole attacks, the group used fake Facebook accounts to build trust with targets before prompting them to click on malicious links, Facebook said. "On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself," Mike Dvilyanski, head of Facebook's cyber espionage investigations, and Nathaniel Gleicher, head of the company's security policy, said the post. "We saw this activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies' actions to disrupt their activity." As detailed in a report from security firm Volexity last year, Insomnia worked on any web browser running in all versions of iOS 10 and 11, as well as iOS 12.0, 12.1, 12.3, 12.3.1 and iOS 12.3.2. Once installed, the malware granted access to a user's Contacts, location, Messages data, and information from third-party apps. Apple patched the offending WebKit flaw in <e2>iOS 12.4</e2>, though devices running older versions of the operating system were left open to attack. [SEP]

Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router’s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router’s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall. For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats. Everyday users can do the same by checking the router’s DNS settings if they’ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware. We have worked with Google and they ensure that Google Play Protect proactively catches apps of this nature. No instances of these apps were found in Google Play.

[CLS] NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which <e2>Forbes</e2> discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers. The versions aimed at Google's mobile operating system were first discovered in late 2016. Though just a few dozen of 1.4 billion Android devices were infected by Pegasus, and the two samples uncovered dated back to 2014, they still represented a significant find in the "surveillance-ware" world, according to researchers at Lookout. The firm's vice president of security intelligence Mike Murray wrote the Pegasus campaign against Android was "one of the most sophisticated and targeted mobile attacks we've seen in the wild." Lookout investigated the malware, also known as Chrysaor, with Google, just as it collaborated with the <e1>University of Toronto</e1>'s Citizen Lab in uncovering Pegasus for iPhone. [SEP]
[CLS] That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an <e1>Amnesty International</e1> staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2>.” The spyware has been abused in this way in the past – in 2017, it was discovered that dozens of Mexican journalists and lawyers (and even a child) had their devices infected by Pegasus in a campaign believed to be carried out by the nation’s government. [SEP]
[CLS] In its original incarnation, the app targeted users in South Korea and <e2>Japan</e2>. Recently, though, the app has become far more ambitious and is now starting to target users across the globe. Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, Germany, the UK, and the United States. The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn’t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user’s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user’s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information. As to where the malware originated from, researchers claim that all signs point to a Chinese group known as “<e1>Roaming Mantis</e1>.” Cybereason concludes: The malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware, bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated, evasive, and well-equipped.

[CLS] Apple does little to discourage the impression — the “fruit company” doesn’t even allow antivirus solutions in its <e1>App Store</e1>, because, you know, allegedly they’re not needed. The keyword here is allegedly. There actually is malware in the wild that targets iOS users — it’s been proved a number of times, and in August 2016 researchers proved it again by revealing the existence of Pegasus, spyware capable of hacking any iPad or iPhone, harvesting data about the victim, and establishing surveillance on them. That discovery made the whole cybersecurity world… uneasy. At our Security Analyst Summit, researchers from Lookout revealed that Pegasus exists not only for iOS, but for Android as well. The Android version is different in some ways from its iOS predecessor. Let’s shed some light on Pegasus and explain why we use the word “ultimate” to describe it. Pegasus: The beginning Pegasus was discovered thanks to Ahmed Mansoor, a UAE human rights activist, who happened to be one of its targets. It was a spear-phishing attack: He received several SMS messages that contained what he thought were malicious links, so he sent those messages to security experts from Citizen Lab, and they brought another cybersecurity firm, Lookout, to the investigation. Mansoor was right. If he had clicked, his iPhone would have been infected with malware — malware for iOS. For non-jailbroken iOS, to be precise. The malware was dubbed Pegasus, and Lookout researchers called it the most sophisticated attack they’d ever seen on any endpoint. Pegasus has been attributed to the NSO Group, an Israeli company whose bread and butter is developing spyware. That means the malware is commercial — it’s sold to whoever is willing to pay for it. Pegasus relied on a whopping three <e2>zero-day (previously unknown) vulnerabilities</e2> in iOS that allowed it to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software. [SEP]
[CLS] Researchers from The Citizen Lab scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company <e1>NSO Group</e1> as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the <e2>Middle East</e2> – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018.

In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, <e2>Google</e2>, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.

[CLS] DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or <e2>social media</e2> accounts. In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed <e1>Black Rose Lucy</e1>, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction.

[CLS] Meet Monokle, an Android Malware Family Capable of Stealing and Changing Passwords Special Technology Center (STC) is a software development company based in Saint Petersburg, <e2>Russia</e2>, and the American Government hasn't been particularly happy with it. In 2016, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on STC because his administration believed that it was one of the three companies that helped the Russian government interfere with the USA's 2016 presidential elections. It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for STC, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called Monokle. Monokle and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible. Lookout's experts think, however, that there is plenty of evidence linking Monokle to STC. According to Lookout's technical report, STC is in the business of developing, among other things, a suite of defensive products for Android devices which is allegedly sold exclusively to <e1>Russian government agencies</e1>. The company also has a control panel application called App Control through which the rest of STC's services are managed. [SEP]

[CLS] Rooting trojans The <e1>Zen</e1> authors have also created a rooting trojan. Using a publicly available rooting framework, the PHA attempts to root devices and gain persistence on them by reinstalling itself on the system partition of rooted device. Installing apps on the system partition makes it harder for the user to remove the app. This technique only works for unpatched devices running Android 4.3 or lower. Devices running Android 4.4 and higher are protected by Verified Boot. Zen's rooting trojan apps target a specific device model with a very specific system image. After achieving root access the app tries to replace the framework.jar file on the system partition. Replicating framework.jar allows the app to intercept and modify the behavior of the Android standard API. In particular, these apps try to add an additional method called statistics() into the Activity class. When inserted, this method runs every time any Activity object in any Android app is created. This happens all the time in regular Android apps, as Activity is one of the fundamental Android UI elements. The only purpose of this method is to connect to the C&C server. The Zen trojan After achieving persistence, the trojan downloads additional payloads, including another trojan called Zen. Zen requires root to work correctly on the Android operating system. The Zen trojan uses its root privileges to turn on accessibility service (a service used to allow Android users with disabilities to use their devices) for itself by writing to a system-wide setting value enabled_accessibility_services. Zen doesn't even check for the root privilege: it just assumes it has it. This leads us to believe that Zen is just part of a larger infection chain. The trojan implements three accessibility services directed at different Android API levels and uses these accessibility services, chosen by checking the operating system version, to create new Google accounts. This is done by opening the <e2>Google</e2> account creation process and parsing the current view. [SEP]

[CLS] " Lookout and <e1>Google</e1> said that though the samples date from 2014, there was evidence the spyware was working on some victim Android phones when discovered in the last few months. All known targets have been alerted. While the iOS version removed itself if it detected a jailbreak, the Android tool would delete if it couldn't contact command and control servers for a set period of time. Or if certain tools, revealed by "antidote files," that could detect the malware were spied by Pegasus, it would disappear. One of the samples, aimed at Samsung phones, removed the manufacturer's system update app to prevent security fixes from disrupting its snooping. Flossman believes that Pegasus for Android was delivered in a similar fashion to its iPhone equivalent, via an SMS message. "The various exploits contained in this surveillance-ware would attempt to be run once the app was installed," Flossman said. "If these exploits were patched on the target device, Pegasus would still be able to function but with a reduced set of capabilities." Google said Pegasus never found its way onto the official Play store. But it wasn't clear, in the case of the Android attacks, if any zero-days were used to exploit devices and then install the malware. Instead, a known technique called Framaroot, which uses exploits named after Lord of the Rings characters, was used to "root" the device, where the attacker gains almost full control over the operating system. Other Android samples may use zero-days, Lookout warned. Google found most targets were located in Israel, though individuals in numerous countries were targeted, including <e2>Georgia</e2>, Mexico, Turkey and the UAE. [SEP]

[CLS] Ginp - A malware patchwork borrowing from <e1>Anubis</e1> Intro ThreatFabric analysts have recently investigated an interesting new strain of banking malware. The malware was first spotted by Tatyana Shishkova from Kaspersky by end October 2019, but actually dates back to June 2019. It is still under active development, with at least 5 different versions of the Trojan released within the last 5 months (June - November 2019). What makes Ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware. In addition, its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on Spanish banks. Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then their credit card details. Although multi-step overlays are not something new, their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion. Evolution The initial version of the malware dates back to early June 2019, masquerading as a “Google Play Verificator” app. At that time, Ginp was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, <e2>WhatsApp</e2>, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. [SEP]

[CLS] " As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of <e2>HummingWhale</e2> is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps. When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine. That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues. Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate Google Play. It has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device. Until now, Android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities. Ginning the ratings To implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by HummingWhale uses DroidPlugin, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company Qihoo 360, Check Point said.

Anubis is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting financial and banking apps available for the platform. Last year, researchers discovered two malicious apps, Currency Converter and <e1>BatterySaverMobo</e1>, that were infecting devices with Anubis to steal user credentials. [SEP]
[CLS] <e1>Cerberus</e1> - A new banking Trojan from the underworld August 2019 Intro In June 2019, ThreatFabric analysts found a new Android malware, dubbed “Cerberus”, being rented out on underground forums. Its authors claim that it was used for private operations for two years preceding the start of the rental. They also state that the code is written from scratch and is not using parts of other existing banking Trojans unlike many other Trojans that are either based completely on the source of another Trojan (such as the leaked Anubis source code that is now being resold) or at least borrow parts of other Trojans. After thorough analysis we can confirm that Cerberus was indeed not based on the Anubis source code. One peculiar thing about the actor group behind this banking malware is that they have an “official” twitter account that they use to post promotional content (even videos) about the malware. Oddly enough they also use it to make fun of the AV community, sharing detection screenshots from <e2>VirusTotal</e2> (thus leaking IoC) and even engaging in discussions with malware researchers directly. [SEP]
[CLS] Backdoor Commands The <e2>Red Alert</e2> code also contains an embedded list of commands the botmaster can send to the bot. The malware can execute a variety of arbitrary commands, including (for example) intercepting or sending text messages without the user’s knowledge, obtaining a copy of the victim’s Address Book, or call or text message logs, or sending phone network feature codes (also known as USSD codes). C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app’s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we’ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we’ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we’ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on port 7878/tcp. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a Twitter account. Static analysis of the code reveals that the malware downloads the overlay template to use against any of the bank(s) it is targeting. The malware also sends regular telemetry back to its C2 server about the infected device in the form of an HTTP POST to its C2 server. It uses the base Dalvik User-Agent string for the device it’s running on. The list of banks targeted by Red Alert 2.0 includes NatWest, Barclays, Westpac, and Citibank. Red Alert 2.0 is a banking bot that is currently very active online, and presents a risk to Android devices. We expect to see more diversification in the social engineering lures this threat group employs as time goes on. So far, legitimate app stores appear to be this malware’s Achilles heel; disabling the installation of third-party apps has been an effective prevention measure. Stick to Google Play and use VPN software from reputable vendors. Sophos detects all the samples of this Trojan family as <e1>Andr/Banker-GWC</e1> and Andr/Spybot-A. [SEP]
[CLS] Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, <e1>GnatSpy</e1>, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps. In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages. Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, Google, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background. "Spyware is a growing threat in an increasingly connected world," <e2>Kohli</e2> said. [SEP]
[CLS] Ginning the ratings To implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by HummingWhale uses <e1>DroidPlugin</e1>, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company Qihoo 360, Check Point said. HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. Gooligan, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the <e2>Shedun</e2> malware family. [SEP]
[CLS] ” Security Without Borders told <e1>Threatpost</e1> that around 25 variants of the spyware was uploaded to Google Play – and while <e2>Google</e2> did not share the total number infected, researchers said that based on the installs they have observed they can estimate the number of infections to reach into the several hundreds of victims or even a thousand.

[CLS] Super Mario Run Malware #2 – <e2>DroidJack</e2> RAT Gamers love Mario and Pokemon, but so do malware authors. A few days back, we wrote about an Android Marcher trojan variant posing as the Super Mario Run game for Android. We have found another instance of malware posing as the Super Mario Run Android app, and this time it has taken the form of DroidJack RAT (remote access trojan). Proofpoint wrote about the DroidJack RAT side-loaded with the Pokemon GO app back in July 2016; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package. The authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the Super Mario Run game to target eagerly waiting Android users. Details: Name : Super Mario Run Package Name : net.droidjack.server MD5 : <e1>69b4b32e4636f1981841cbbe3b927560</e1> Technical Analysis: The malicious package claims to be the Super Mario Run game, as shown in the permissions screenshot below, but in reality this is a malicious RAT called DroidJack (also known as SandroRAT) that is getting installed.

[CLS] “The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers <e2>Nikita Buchka</e2> and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research. Clues as to who is behind the malware trace back to the Italian firm Negg International. Researchers said domains used for landing pages to spread the malware were registered to the company. Negg International did not return requests for comment. According to the company’s website, it offers a wide range of app development, pen testing and cybersecurity consulting services. Kaspersky Lab said Skygofree victims were likely infected via malicious redirects or man-in-the-middle attacks driving users to landing pages that mimic mobile carrier web sites. Those landing pages included similar domain names and web page content to wireless carriers. Once targets were lured to landing page sites they were prompted to update their phone’s software. “Dear Customer, in order to avoid malfunctions to your internet connection, we encourage you to upgrade your configuration. Download the update now and keep on navigating at maximum speed,” read one fake landing page targeting Vodafone customers. Researchers describe Skygofree as a complex system capable of a wide range of spying, similar to Pegasus discovered in August 2016. Pegasus was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the NSO Group. Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident. Kaspersky Lab said in the case of Skygofree, it was only aware of a handful of users in Italy being targeted with the malware. Those Italian links have also prompted comparison between Skygofree and Italy-based intrusion software vendor HackingTeam. <e1>HackingTeam</e1> is known for selling surveillance and intrusion software products designed to help law enforcement agencies and other customers perform remote penetration and control of target systems.

[CLS] Android <e1>DroidJack</e1> Malware Spreading Via 'Over-The Top' Services RAT finding new ways to spread that work around carrier and phone defenses. In a sign that malware developers are keeping up the full-court press with ingenuity in obfuscating their attacks, the powerful Android DroidJack remote access tool (RAT) was shown today to employ a new means of distribution: via so-called over the top (OTT) carrier services. According to a report out by AdaptiveMobile, the makers of DroidJack are doing an end around of mobile carrier and on-device protections by spreading it through OTT services. OTT, which includes heavy-hitting services like Microsoft's Skype or Facebook's <e2>WhatsApp</e2> services, has grown in proliferation as mobile APIs and integration have advanced in recent years.

Cybercriminals typically use third-party app marketplaces to distribute their malicious apps, but in operations such as the ones that distributed CPUMINER, BankBot, and MilkyDoor, they would try to get their apps published on Google Play or App Store. We’ve also seen others take a more subtle approach that involves SmiShing to direct potential victims to malicious pages.

[CLS] The new variants have "incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains," Sophos threat researcher <e2>Pankaj Kohli</e2> said in a report published Tuesday. Also known by the monikers <e1>VAMP</e1>, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

[CLS] The Sphinx campaign operators cloaked the malware with icons of legitimate applications to dupe recipients into clicking them. <e1>Sphinx</e1> was active between June 2014 and November 2015, but timestamps of the malware indicate the attacks started as early as 2011. A simple WHOIS query of AnubisSpy’s C&C server showed it abused a legitimate managed hosting service provider in Belize. We correlated the AnubisSpy variants to Sphinx’s desktop/PC-targeting malware through the following: Shared C&C server, 86[.]105[.]18[.]107 Shared technique of decrypting JSON files, and similarity between the file structures of AnubisSpy and Sphinx’s malware Similar targets (highly concentrated in Middle Eastern countries) These apps were all written in Arabic and, in one way or another, related to something in Egypt (i.e., spoofing an Egypt-based TV program and using news/stories in the Middle East) regardless of the labels and objects in the apps. Our coordination with Google also revealed that these apps were installed across a handful of countries in the Middle East. Was AnubisSpy actively distributed? We analyzed seven apps that were actually AnubisSpy. These were signed with the same fake Google certificates. We found two more apps created by the same developer, but they had no espionage-related codes; we think they were made as experimental projects. Based on hardcoded strings in the Agent Version, the malicious apps were developed as early as April 2015. Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on June 2015; the latest variant was signed on May 2017. AnubisSpy wasn’t only published on Google Play. We also found versions of it in third-party app marketplaces, most likely as a way to expand the malware’s reach. The apps mainly used Middle East-based news and sociopolitical themes as social engineering hooks and abused social media to further proliferate. Versions of AnubisSpy posed as social news, promotional, healthcare, and entertainment apps. What does AnubisSpy mean to the mobile landscape? Persistent and furtive <e2>spyware</e2> is an underrated problem for the mobile platform. [SEP]
[CLS] Despite Cerberus’ Russian speaking developers earmarking a new vision for the project in <e2>April</e2> this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team. Due to an unclear culmination of factors, the author later decided to publish the project source code for premium users on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum. The result has been an immediate rise in mobile application infections and attempts to steal money from consumers in Russia and across Europe, as more and more cybercriminals acquire the malware for free. Since first tracking its activity in 2019, the sophistication of Cerberus has been elevated to new levels of functionality, in much the same way as <e1>Anubis</e1> – another Android banking malware example which went public in late 2019 to the detriment of customers and banks themselves.

Case in point: a campaign we recently observed that uses SMS as an entry point to deliver an information stealer we called FakeSpy (Trend Micro detects this threat ANDROIDOS_FAKESPY.HRX). FakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and call records stored in the infected device. FakeSpy can also serve as a vector for a banking trojan (ANDROIDOS_LOADGFISH.HRX). While the malware is currently limited to infecting Japanese and Korean-speaking users, we won't be surprised if it expands its reach given the way FakeSpy’s authors actively fine-tune the malware’s configurations. Attack Chain Would-be victims will first receive a mobile text message masquerading as a legitimate message from a Japanese logistics and transportation company urging recipients to click the link in the SMS, as shown in Figure 1. The link will redirect them to the malicious webpage, and clicking any button will prompt users to download an <e2>Android</e2> application package (APK). [SEP]
[CLS] Cyberespionage Campaign Sphinx Goes Mobile With AnubisSpy Android malware like <e2>ransomware</e2> exemplify how the platform can be lucrative for cybercriminals. But there are also other threats stirring up as of late: attacks that spy on and steal data from specific targets, crossing over between desktops and mobile devices. Take for instance several malicious apps we came across with cyberespionage capabilities, which were targeting Arabic-speaking users or Middle Eastern countries. These were published on Google Play — but have since been taken down — and third-party app marketplaces. We named these malicious apps AnubisSpy (ANDROIDOS_ANUBISSPY) as all the malware’s payload is a package called watchdog.

[CLS] To track various Pegasus operators, researchers at The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> also developed a novel technique (dubbed Athena) to cluster matches of the spyware’s servers into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator. Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator’s servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. “We designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,” researchers said. “Our technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.” The 45 countries found harboring the spyware are: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, <e2>India</e2>, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Zambia.

[CLS] The URLs — abused as part of XLoader’s C&C — are hidden in three webpages, and the C&C server that <e1>XLoader</e1> connects to differ per region. The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time. XLoader abuses the MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission. Mitigations XLoader will not download malicious apps if the Android device uses a mobile data connection. Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router’s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router’s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall. For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats. Everyday users can do the same by checking the router’s DNS settings if they’ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware. We have worked with Google and they ensure that Google Play Protect proactively catches apps of this nature. No instances of these apps were found in <e2>Google Play</e2>. Indicators of Compromise Hashes detected as ANDROIDOS_XLOADER. [SEP]
[CLS] Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and Denmark, including <e1>Post Denmark</e1>. This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as MazarBOT. Heimdal explains in a blog post that the campaign begins with the following SMS message: In English, the text message reads: “Your package is available for pick up. Follow link to see all the information on your package.” Clicking on the shortened link leads to www[.]fhsinsaat.com/apk/post.apk, a URL which downloads the infected Android installation application file for MazarBOT. Security researchers at real-time threat intelligence firm Recorded Future first detected the Android malware back in November of 2015. They found MazarBOT for sale on an underground web market. At the time, there was no indication any real-life malware campaigns were actively distributing MazarBOT. That has since changed. In February, news broke of a malware campaign infecting users with MazarBOT. The malware spread via SMS texts that asked users to click on a link in order to view a multimedia message. That link, in turn, loaded the malware’s APK file. Once it has been fully downloaded onto a computer, MazarBOT has the ability to open, monitor and control backdoors on the victim’s Android device; send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, which will increase the victim’s mobile phone bill; read SMS messages, including two-step verification codes; use the “Polipo proxy” to launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks; and inject itself in the mobile Google Chrome browser. Currently, this particular MazarBOT campaign is believed to have affected 400 Android devices in <e2>Denmark</e2> and 1,500 in Italy. [SEP]

[CLS] The rise of Cerberus: Android banking malware is available for free in underground forums Mobile banking users face a new threat following the free release of <e1>Cerberus</e1> Cerberus is a sophisticated Android banking malware, originally tracked in the summer of 2019, and actively distributed on a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) basis across various underground forums. The recent source code leak – referred to as Cerberus v2 – opens up new, public opportunities for cybercriminals looking to threaten the banking sector through Android devices.

[CLS] " As was the case with <e1>HummingBad</e1>, the purpose of HummingWhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps. When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine. That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues. Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate Google Play. It has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device. Until now, Android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities. Ginning the ratings To implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by HummingWhale uses DroidPlugin, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company Qihoo 360, Check Point said.

It’s also possible that while AnubisSpy’s operators may also be Sphinx’s, they could be running separate but similar campaigns. What can AnubisSpy do? AnubisSpy can steal messages (SMS), photos, videos, contacts, email accounts, calendar events, and browser histories (i.e., Chrome and Samsung Internet Browser). It can also take screenshots and record audio, including calls. It can spy on the victim through apps installed on the device, a list of which is in its configuration file that can be updated.

[CLS] <e1>MazarBOT</e1> Android Malware Distributed via SMS Spoofing Campaign In the fall of 2015, Heimdal Security detected a post-office email scam targeting unsuspecting Danish users. The campaign sent out fake emails purporting to originate from PostNord and Post Denmark. When clicked on, the infected emails downloaded Cryptolocker2 ransomware onto users’ machines. Several months later, Heimdal has now spotted another scam campaign spoofing legitimate organizations in Italy and Denmark, including Post Denmark. This campaign uses spam SMS messages to distribute a form of Android malware known as MazarBOT. Heimdal explains in a blog post that the campaign begins with the following SMS message: In English, the text message reads: “Your package is available for pick up. Follow link to see all the information on your package.” Clicking on the shortened link leads to www[.]fhsinsaat.com/apk/post.apk, a URL which downloads the infected Android installation application file for MazarBOT. Security researchers at real-time threat intelligence firm <e2>Recorded Future</e2> first detected the Android malware back in November of 2015. [SEP]

[CLS] DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In <e2>May 2020</e2>, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn’t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named <e1>Eventbot</e1>, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.

[CLS] It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for STC, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called Monokle. <e1>Monokle</e1> and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible. Lookout's experts think, however, that there is plenty of evidence linking Monokle to STC. According to Lookout's technical report, STC is in the business of developing, among other things, a suite of defensive products for Android devices which is allegedly sold exclusively to <e2>Russian government agencies</e2>. The company also has a control panel application called App Control through which the rest of STC's services are managed. [SEP]
[CLS] A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in <e2>Australia</e2>, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too. Red Alert 2.0 is also advertised as able to intercept and send SMS messages and launch APKs. The author also claims new functionality is being developed, that injects can be built per customer request, and that updates are being released every two weeks. Miscreants can rent the Trojan starting at $200 for 7 days, $500 for a month, or $999 for 2 months. As part of the analyzed Red Alert 2.0 attack, the malware was being distributed attached to spam messages.

[CLS] It can run commands and delete files on the device, as well as install and uninstall Android Application Packages (APKs). <e1>AnubisSpy</e1> has several modules, each of which has a separate role. AnubisSpy’s code is well constructed, indicating the developer/s’ know-how. Below is a visualization of the modules: How is AnubisSpy related to Sphinx? Sphinx reportedly uses the watering hole technique via social media sites to deliver its payloads — mainly a customized version of njRAT. The Sphinx campaign operators cloaked the malware with icons of legitimate applications to dupe recipients into clicking them. Sphinx was active between June 2014 and November 2015, but timestamps of the malware indicate the attacks started as early as 2011. A simple WHOIS query of AnubisSpy’s C&C server showed it abused a legitimate managed hosting service provider in Belize. We correlated the AnubisSpy variants to Sphinx’s desktop/PC-targeting malware through the following: Shared C&C server, 86[.]105[.]18[.]107 Shared technique of decrypting JSON files, and similarity between the file structures of AnubisSpy and Sphinx’s malware Similar targets (highly concentrated in Middle Eastern countries) These apps were all written in Arabic and, in one way or another, related to something in Egypt (i.e., spoofing an Egypt-based TV program and using news/stories in the Middle East) regardless of the labels and objects in the apps. Our coordination with Google also revealed that these apps were installed across a handful of countries in the Middle East. Was AnubisSpy actively distributed? We analyzed seven apps that were actually AnubisSpy. These were signed with the same fake Google certificates. We found two more apps created by the same developer, but they had no espionage-related codes; we think they were made as experimental projects. Based on hardcoded strings in the Agent Version, the malicious apps were developed as early as April 2015. Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on <e2>June 2015</e2>; the latest variant was signed on May 2017. [SEP]
[CLS] Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and <e2>Desert Scorpion</e2>, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the <e1>APT-C-23</e1> threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.

[CLS] OTPs generated through <e1>Google</e1> Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. "Despite Cerberus' Russian speaking developers earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team," Kaspersky says. "Due to an unclear culmination of factors, the author later decided to publish the project source code for premium users on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum." The cybersecurity firm says that following the free release of Cerberus source code in the underground, there was an "immediate rise" in mobile app infections across Europe and Russia. Of particular note, Galov says, is that previous clients were not encouraged to strike <e2>Russian</e2> mobile device users -- but the moment the code was released, the attack landscape changed.

[CLS] Researchers from The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company NSO Group as an offering for state-level actors around the world. “The number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,” Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab’s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread – and alleges that it’s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East – particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. “Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO’s global proliferation,” researchers said in a Tuesday post. “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2> and the United Arab Emirates.

[CLS] The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; <e1>NSO</e1>’s clients weren’t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn’t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as Chrysaor — that’s what Google calls it. The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that’s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. Pegasus for Android was also spotted in Turkey, <e2>Kenya</e2>, Nigeria, UAE, and other countries. [SEP]
